	(1,'\n          <p>There\'s no shortage of advice on the Internet.  This holds especially true in digital marketing; after all, we’re the folks who came up with “content is king,” right?  If we weren\'t the inventors, we clearly co-opted it.\n</p>\n<p>I’ve been wanting to write a piece that takes us back to the roots of digital marketing. A reminder of sorts; one that might serve to snap some marketers out of the mundane daze of their daily grunt work. I wanted to inspire a vacation from hanging out in the weeds, which unfortunately can be common for some digital marketing practitioners.  Falling into tactics and routine processes without any deviation certainly feels like grunt work — something that marketing should never be.\n</p>\n<p>In reality, there\'s still plenty of life left in classic digital marketing advice. Like music or meals, sometimes the basics still have plenty of flavor left. Maybe you simply have to challenge yourself to hold onto your roots.<br>\n</p>\n<p>So, I decided a great place to collect this general advice is the platform that still hangs onto 140 characters — Twitter.  I wasn\'t looking for anything too specific or particular, just cornerstone digital marketing advice. I posted a few repeated tweets requesting the following:\n</p>\n<center>\n<iframe id=\"twitter-widget-0\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; width: 500px; height: 204.171875px; padding: 0px; border: none; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-tweet-id=\"704744299003559936\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\"></iframe>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></center>\n<p>Next, I’m going to share some of the fantastic responses and expand upon them. Thanks to everyone who helped me out with their responses.\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Marie Haynes\n</h3>\n<center>\n<iframe id=\"twitter-widget-1\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; width: 500px; height: 204.171875px; padding: 0px; border: none; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-tweet-id=\"705419189016596482\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\"></iframe>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></center>\n<p>This is a great tweet to kick things off. My mind immediately goes to the concept of <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/why-good-unique-content-needs-to-die-whiteboard-friday\" target=\"_blank\">10x content, of which Rand is a big proponent</a>. Want to be the best option for searchers? Be the best solution. (Wow, that makes it sound awfully simple!)<br> <br>But it’s true; this translates from the written word to business, and frankly, to life in general. Or what about <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_22_Immutable_Laws_of_Marketing.html?id=e8SgPwAACAAJ&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">The Immutable Laws Of Marketing</a>, where not only being the best — but being <em>perceived</em> as the best — would help you fit into the <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2007/01/15/jack-trout-on-marketing-oped-cx_jt_0116reality.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Law of Perception</a>, among others classic concepts.\n</p>\n<p>Here\'s a quote I\'ve always believed: \"Perception is reality.\" I find it really tough to argue. Even if you think you’re a stud, it doesn\'t mean a thing if your customers do not. Using your own company as an example, you could compete by putting together one hell of a PR game, or you could genuinely build a practice that does the talking for you. If you’re an agency or consultant getting repeat business and having success through referrals, you’re doing something right.  <br><br>Han Solo said it best: “Don’t get cocky, kid. A strong perception will fade if you don’t maintain it with consistently high value.\"  He may not have said the last part.\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>John Doherty\n</h3>\n<center>\n<iframe id=\"twitter-widget-2\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; width: 500px; height: 182.171875px; padding: 0px; border: none; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-tweet-id=\"705078977505816577\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\"></iframe>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></center>\n<p>In my opinion, the heyday of SEO was very much a tactical time. It was a land of scalability and, well, a lexicon of spammy tactics. We spoke and wrote about SEO strategies, but we were often only discussing tactics.\n</p>\n<p>But Google made some significant changes to offset the value of many standalone tactics. Google didn\'t want to be manipulated by SEOs — they wanted to be influenced by valuable websites. I believe we\'re still very much in a rebirth of SEO, and I’m completely in agreement with John — true strategic partnerships are the most valuable SEO relationship you can have today.\n</p>\n<p>Tactics are components of a strategy, built upon a hypothesis and goals, and including milestones. It\'s a bigger picture, but an accountable one as well. Being a strategic thinker is not everyone’s cup of tea, but it can be practiced. I would suspect (and I’ll bet John will agree) that the most success in 2016 will come from those consultants and agencies who master the multi-stepped, multi-faceted, data-driven strategy. And those who have the ability to help their clients execute and implement in parallel.\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Steve Hammer\n</h3>\n<center>\n<iframe id=\"twitter-widget-3\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; width: 500px; height: 223.171875px; padding: 0px; border: none; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-tweet-id=\"705079344301903872\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\"></iframe>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></center>\n<h3>Damon Gochneaur\n</h3>\n<center>\n<iframe id=\"twitter-widget-4\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; width: 500px; height: 245.171875px; padding: 0px; border: none; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-tweet-id=\"705427087687987200\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\"></iframe>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></center>\n<p>Several interesting points here from Steve and Damon. First, measure what really matters to the client. If it’s not revenue, it’s certainly some form of ROI. Let’s be honest: as digital marketers, notably SEOs, this is a serious challenge.\n</p>\n<p>Reporting on rankings and traffic is easy. We have software with report “export” options, but we\'re not hired to be button pushers. In actuality, we are hired to help our clients hit their KPIs, while muddling through a plane of limited visibility through search referrals and unpublished Google metrics. How did we get ourselves into this?\n</p>\n<p>Being goal-oriented is everything. In my opinion, some of the most important questions you can ever ask yourself are:\n</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>Why is this particular task (or strategy) worth doing?</li>\n	<li>How do I measure it?</li>\n	<li>What are the metrics I can use to show my client we had an impact? </li>\n</ul>\n<p>More often than I\'d prefer to admit, I hear from prospects who say, “I don’t know what my last SEO company really did.” <a href=\"https://m.popkey.co/2fdc61/9GA9g.gif\">That’s shocking to me</a>. Why would a client keep an SEO company who failed to communicate up to the required level? But at the end of the day, even if it takes longer than it should, the client does ultimately end up leaving if they don\'t get what they want.  Business 101.\n</p>\n<p>Last, “expect to get fired every time you talk to a client” is truly an interesting one (and one I’ll be stealing). I love it. If you want your client for the long term, try to impress them every time. Have you ever rescued a sour client relationship? It\'s tough being behind the 8-ball. Treat every opportunity like it\'s your last.  That should keep you honest.\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Nick LeRoy\n</h3>\n<center>\n<iframe id=\"twitter-widget-5\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; width: 500px; height: 182.171875px; padding: 0px; border: none; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-tweet-id=\"704803170527133698\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\"></iframe>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></center>\n<p>One of the most beautiful things about digital marketing is the ability to capture loads of data. In the old days, someone sat next to a billboard and clicked a counter as cars drove by, with no sense of engagement or demographics. Now we are so data-rich that going into the campaign creation stage without due diligence is almost negligent. While Google does keep plenty of juicy metrics a secret, we still have client analytics, log files, and even fairly accurate competitor data (a la SEMrush).\n</p>\n<p>At Greenlane, any time we create a campaign for a client, hours of data gathering and looking for stories precedes the actual strategy creation. Does this guarantee success? No. Does it improve the odds? Yes – a helluva lot. A “data-first” position is what the most seasoned marketers adopt, but it should simply be something everyone – no matter how experienced – should adopt. For some right-brained marketers, reading numbers like words it’s a skill you need to learn and practice.\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Jeff Gibbard\n</h3>\n<center>\n<iframe id=\"twitter-widget-6\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; width: 500px; height: 223.171875px; padding: 0px; border: none; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-tweet-id=\"705420577314643968\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\"></iframe>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></center>\n<p>This is a great point. We\'re in the relationship business. This makes us an important line of defense/offense when needed, a challenging partner, and a safe pair of hands to rely upon. When your point-person sees you as a partner, you have an agent defending your honor when it’s time for internal budget reviews. Who\'s the first to get fired? The consultant... unless that consultant does amazing work and is beloved.\n</p>\n<p>Plus, the more frequent the communication, the better the intelligence gathering becomes. How many times have you talked with a client and the conversation took an unexpected turn?\n</p>\n<p>Here\'s an example. An SEO finds themselves talking about an email campaign they knew nothing about. The SEO started to learn about all this content that the email team was creating based on A/B tests. The SEO learned about stockpiles of great content that never appeared anywhere but in customers’ inboxes. This SEO found the motherlode, even though the call was originally about URL structures. (This is a true story. My name was removed to protect my identity).\n</p>\n<p>These conversations are gold, and don’t happen often if you’re not speaking on a routine basis. Enjoy the communication.\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Mark Kennedy\n</h3>\n<center>\n<iframe id=\"twitter-widget-7\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; width: 500px; height: 226.171875px; padding: 0px; border: none; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-tweet-id=\"705084378154672129\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\"></iframe>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></center>\n<p>Are you someone willing to mix it up with a client, or are you just trying to placate them? We’re not here to let our clients eat Big Macs, folks. We’re being hired to tell them there’s over 500 calories in that hamburger, and give them reasons why they should or shouldn’t eat it. Our job is to empower clients with what we’ve learned in the steps we’ve taken before. I proudly tell new prospects that \"we will fight for our ideas if we really believe them to be the best.\" I’ve never had anyone reject us for that statement that I know of. Even if they have, I’d argue that we probably dodged a bullet ourselves.\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Corey Eulas\n</h3>\n<center>\n<iframe id=\"twitter-widget-8\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; width: 500px; height: 160.171875px; padding: 0px; border: none; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-tweet-id=\"704099074149113857\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\"></iframe>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></center>\n<p>The “Keep It Simple, Stupid” Principle. It’s a great principal in marketing, especially in design and usability. But I agree with Corey that the same holds true with digital marketing.<br>\n</p>\n<p>A fantastic way to balance your relationship with the client is to understand what level of complexity they want. Do they want massive amounts of data, or would some visualization help them get the point faster?\n</p>\n<p>I love our attorneys (said nobody ever, and this is from a guy whose ex-wife is a divorce attorney). They\'re great at expediting a phone meeting, giving us just what we need, and executing on follow ups. I hate law and don\'t understand most of it. But when we have a need, they do a fantastic job of relaying it to me in my language. It\'s an incredibly important trait of any service provider. As I am with tax law, most of our clients are the same with SEO. Keep it simple.\n</p>\n<p>Albert Einstein said: \"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.\" It’s a balance which brings valuable results.\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Chad Lio\n</h3>\n<center>\n<iframe id=\"twitter-widget-9\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; width: 500px; height: 226.171875px; padding: 0px; border: none; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-tweet-id=\"704365414395019264\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\"></iframe>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></center>\n<p>I like this a lot. It’s the advice I give many clients who either have relatively young websites or aggressive competition. SEO is organic — start with a few sectional wins, and Google will start noticing your website as a whole. The niche (sometimes within the niche) is often areas of lower competition and higher opportunity. Hit those areas hard. Get a good footing there and create a roadmap for expansion.\n</p>\n<p>Let’s say you’re an eCommerce site who sells nothing but buttons. Looking at Google\'s Keyword Planner, \"Mother of Pearl Buttons\" (whatever they are) has a search volume of 880 monthly estimated searches. Not a huge number, but pretty high for a small niche campaign. Showing your customers and Google that you’re the master of Mother of Pearl Buttons is really not above the reach of even the smallest company. You will live in infamy, kind of.\n</p>\n<hr style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\"><strong></strong>\n<h3>Dan Kern\n</h3>\n<center>\n<iframe id=\"twitter-widget-10\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; width: 500px; height: 226.171875px; padding: 0px; border: none; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-tweet-id=\"726339342692700161\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\"></iframe>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></center>\n<p>Here\'s an analogy I occasionally use when talking to prospects who are thinking of merely dabbling with SEO for a only a brief period.\n</p>\n<p> \"SEO is like a big game of King of the Mountain. On your mountain, you have many aggressive competitors all climbing towards the top. Someone will always get there. Then, without warning, Google might make a change and knock away all your progress, starting you at the bottom again. Not guaranteed, but this can happen to the other climbers as well. You have two choices: quit the game, or play to win in this routine scenario.  SEO is a game that\'s not for the weak of heart.  But keep in mind, when you do win, your rewards should offset all your losses.\"\n</p>\n<p>That analogy either produces excitement or pause, and I think this is important. We should encourage our clients to understand the true rules of engagement with SEO.\n</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Phil Nottingham\n</h3>\n<center>\n<iframe id=\"twitter-widget-11\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; width: 500px; height: 160.171875px; padding: 0px; border: none; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-tweet-id=\"726247637389860865\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\"></iframe>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></center>\n<p>Without a doubt, this is my favorite piece of advice in the entire article.

In this final post we’ll cover accessibility and SEO overlaps when coding for media elements.\n</p><h2>Images and non-text elements</h2><p>As you can imagine, images online can be problematic for visually impaired visitors to decipher, but luckily we’re using technology here so you and I can help solve that issue with the proper coding on and around images and non-text elements.\n</p><p>Some examples of images and non-text elements are:\n</p><ul>\n	<li>Images, including graphs and charts, word art, decorative and background images, webcam images, photographs</li>\n	<li><a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/seo-accessibility-formatting-and-links\" target=\"_blank\">Infographics</a></li>\n	<li>Image maps</li>\n	<li>Animations</li>\n	<li>Graphical buttons</li>\n	<li>Captchas</li>\n</ul><p>Here are some of the things you can optimize around images and non-text elements for better accessibility.\n</p><h3>Alt attributes</h3><p>Image alt attributes in SEO are used to describe to search bots what the image is or what the image points to if the image is a link. If a link, the alt attribute acts like keyword anchor text, helping Google understand the context of the destination page.\n</p><p>Alt attributes on images are also read by screen readers. Here’s a quick example:\n</p><p align=\"center\">\n	<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hzXsYdLpGso\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\">\n	</iframe>\n</p><p>Alt attributes are a win-win optimization for accessibility and SEO, but there are some things to keep in mind, particularly these first two items below, when optimizing alt attributes for screen readers.\n</p><h3>Alt attribute do’s and don’ts:</h3><ul>\n	<li><strong>Don’t use alt attributes on decorative images</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decorative/\" target=\"_blank\">Decorative images</a> of clouds on your health insurance website are not a hook for getting image search traffic and are not useful in providing context to screen readers. A decorative image can still look dreamy to sighted users but not get in the way of navigating through the page for visually impaired users by keeping the alt attribute as alt=”” (null), or by making it a background image.</li>\n	<li><strong>Don’t use alt when there’s also a text link:</strong> If the image is a link <em>and</em> there is link text next to the image, both pointing to the same destination, the screen reader will read both and it sounds repetitive and weird. Use alt=”” (null) for the image alt and keep the anchor text pointing to the destination page about the topic. This may be contested by SEOs who want to put the alt attributes on the image to help it rank in image search. What I’d recommend in a case like this one is to use the alt attributes on the images on the <em>destination</em> page, since that’s the page you’d want to appear in SERPS anyway (probably a great topic to debate more in the comments).</li>\n	<li><strong>Do keep it short or use captions:</strong> There are some traces of recommendations around the web that the JAWS screen reader doesn’t do well with alt attributes over 125 characters. Whether that’s true or not, it’s more user-friendly to keep alt attributes short. If you’d like to understand why, add a screen reader extension to your browser (like <a href=\"http://www.chromevox.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ChromeVox for Chrome</a> or <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fangs-screen-reader-emulator/\" target=\"_blank\">Fangs for Firefox</a>) and navigate around a page with images that have long alt attributes. If you have a lot to say about an image, put it in caption text or describe it in text on the page instead of in the alt.</li>\n	<li><strong>Don’t keyword stuff — write naturally.</strong> Let’s consider the health insurance website with decorative cloud images example again. An SEO may see five decorative cloud images on a landing page as five opportunities to stuff “health insurance, health insurance tools, health tools” etc. into the alt attributes. <em>Don’t do it.</em> It’s not only noise to screen readers, it can be confusing and annoying. Plus, realistically, no one is doing <em>image</em> searches for “health insurance” — and even if they were, the chances of them clicking on a picture of clouds in search results expecting to get what they’re looking for is pretty slim. Similarly, make sure your alt attributes are descriptive and make sense — write them for people, not just a bunch of keywords for bots.</li>\n</ul><h2>Image captioning</h2><p>Google can <a href=\"http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&amp;r=1&amp;p=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PTXT&amp;S1=7,913,163.PN.&amp;OS=pn/7,913,163&amp;RS=PN/7,913,163\" target=\"_blank\">segment</a> text near an image to attribute that text to the image and even create its <a href=\"http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2014/11/a-picture-is-worth-thousand-coherent.html\" target=\"_blank\">own captions</a>; therefore, text near an image can help provide context and could affect rankings. Image captioning also provides context for screen readers, often providing more context than an alt attribute might, or in place of an alt attribute if one is not known at the time of upload.\n</p><h3>Image captioning do’s and don’ts:</h3><ul>\n	<li><strong>Don’t use alt attribute if there is an image caption.</strong> Similar to the anchor text link, describing an image via alt attributes and a caption can be repetitive. This could also be a debatable practice, as SEOs would likely want to use both. In that case, consider how it will read by a screen reader that reads both a caption and an alt attribute, and try to make the best decision that will work for both</li>\n	<li><strong>Do describe what you’re captioning</strong>. For example, use “Figure 1:” so that this captioning tag is properly understood by people using assistive technologies that may not recognize the tag.</li>\n	<li><strong>Optional: Do use a &lt;<a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_figcaption.asp\" target=\"_blank\">figcaption</a>&gt; tag:</strong> &lt;figure&gt; with &lt;figcaption&gt; tags can be applied to images or other page elements. Figcaption isn’t necessarily a known tag to optimize for SEO and they aren’t a must-do for screen readers, but it sounds like Google <a href=\"https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/webmasters/gJGnhzttYBQ/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">does try to index the text</a> within a tag whether it recognizes the tag or not, and despite <a href=\"http://www.powermapper.com/tests/screen-readers/labelling/img-figcaption/\" target=\"_blank\">figcaption’s variable readability by screen readers</a>, the text may be considered as a related element to an image for screen readers and hopefully helpful nonetheless. </li>\n</ul><h2>Text-as-images</h2><p>The reasons to avoid text as images are similar for SEO as accessibility: Simply avoid text within an image if you want the text to be able to be machine-read. Text as an image is also not always ideal for people needing to use magnifiers, since magnifying text in an image can be pixelated and hard to read.\n</p><h3>Text-as-images do’s and don’ts:</h3><ul>\n	<li><strong>Don’t use text as images for important information.</strong> If you must use text as an image, <em>do</em> use an alt attribute to describe the image text if it’s something that should be read by search bots and screen readers.</li>\n	<li><strong>Do consider styling actual text as an alternative</strong>. If you need your text to look a certain way, style it using HTML + CSS or use <a href=\"https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2010/08/google-now-indexes-svg.html\" target=\"_blank\">SVG</a> (Scalable Vector Graphics).</li>\n</ul><h2>Infographics</h2><p>Infographics have historically been popular among SEOs for attracting links that boost rankings. SEOs may also want to provide on-page context of the infographic and its parts to search engines.\n</p><p>For accessibility, the idea is to be able to easily determine what the infographic portrays. Screen readers, unlike search engines, can’t determine the infographic page’s context by using the link text and page content of the hundreds of pages linking to your infographic. For screen readers it’s all up to the on-page code signals, and you can imagine that describing a complex infographic would be weighty for an alt attribute. Also consider the <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/seo-accessibility-formatting-and-links\" target=\"_blank\">use of color for colorblind users or the problem we encounter with text as images</a> (not “readable,” scales pixelated) that we covered in part 2.\n</p><p>There is not a simple &lt;infographic&gt; tag that lets you add a lengthy, thorough description of the infographic like a long alt attribute (although you can consider longdesc below). Rather, I’d recommend you test out these tactics below to see what works best for you and your particular situation:\n</p><h3>Infographic do’s and don’ts:</h3><ul>\n	<li><strong>Don’t describe the whole thing in an alt attribute</strong>. It’s terribly user-unfriendly for screen readers (can’t navigate through the text, copy or paste it, etc). Use alts as they’re meant to be used, and choose another method for long descriptions.</li>\n	<li><strong>Do adhere to color contrast requirements.</strong> Plan ahead when thinking about color for your infographic, and use colors that meet the minimum <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html\" target=\"_blank\">color contrast requirements</a>. <a href=\"https://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/\" target=\"_blank\">Use this tool</a> to help you out.</li>\n	<li><strong>Do consider ARIA-describedby.</strong> This ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Application) attribute is read in addition to alt text on an image, and allows for a long description. Here’s a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdv8lXN5amo\" target=\"_blank\">video example</a>. Note that because describedby is announced in addition to image alt text, this can be repetitive.</li>\n	<li><strong>The longdesc attribute:</strong> This image attribute allows you to provide a machine-readable link to long descriptions for images (either within the page or on a separate page), but <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_longdesc.asp\" target=\"_blank\">isn’t well-supported</a> and to my knowledge also isn’t a working SEO technique. </li>\n	<li><strong>Do consider hidden text alternates</strong>: See the <a href=\"https://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/clip-hidden-content-better-accessibility-53456.html\" target=\"_blank\">example in the previous post of an image infographic provided as an easily shareable piece within an iFrame with indexable text</a> hidden in a CSS clip in the iFrame HTML. </li>\n	<li><strong>Do create your infographic using CSS:</strong> This is a great solution. Below are two pages with the same infographic and how each of them look cached in Google. One is an image file with the text and links on the page below it. The other is an infographic with indexable text and links created via HTML + CSS.</li>\n</ul><p><strong>Left</strong>: Infographic as image (<a href=\"http://webaim.org/resources/designers/\" target=\"_blank\">the page</a> also provides the infographic text on the page).\n</p><p><strong>Right</strong>: Infographic provided as HTML styled with CSS (<a href=\"http://throup.org.uk/infographic/\" target=\"_blank\">source here</a>).\n</p><p><img src=\"//d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/57563f9238e783.82439342.jpg\" alt=\"Left: image infographic. Right: HTML infographic.\">\n</p><p>You’ll notice they look incredibly similar.\n</p><p>Let’s look at the code. Here’s Google’s cache of the infographic text content of each page.\n</p><p><strong>Top</strong>: Google cache (partial) of infographic text provided on the image infographic page.\n</p><p><strong>Bottom</strong>: Google cache (partial) of infographic text <em>in the infographic</em> on the CSS infographic page.\n</p><p><img src=\"//d2v4zi8pl64nxt.cloudfront.net/seo-accessibility-images-video/575642685a5a82.81947282.jpg\" alt=\"Google cache (partial) of infographic text provided on the image infographic page\">\n</p><p><img src=\"//d2v4zi8pl64nxt.cloudfront.net/seo-accessibility-images-video/57564268cff225.43947712.jpg\" alt=\"Google cache (partial) of infographic text in the infographic on the CSS infographic page.\">\n</p><p>Both provide indexable and screen readable solutions. The CSS version does it without having to also duplicate the information in text on the page for sighted visitors.\n</p><p>You may have noticed the CSS version also adds helpful invisible display:none section headers, which are seen by the screen readers but not visible in the infographic.

Video transcription is helpful to hearing-impaired visitors who can’t hear the video, or to interpret words for people watching something in another language or strong accents. It’s also helpful to anyone watching a video with sound that’s tough to hear, when watching video in a loud room, or when you need to watch with no sound.\n</p><p>Similarly for search engines, video transcripts describe the content of a video via text.\n</p><h3>Video subtitling and captioning</h3><p>Subtitles and captioning provide <em>time-synced</em> text along with a video while it plays. Subtitles provide the dialogue, while captioning provides the dialogue and also describes other sounds like music, sound effects and speaker identification.\n</p><p>Options for providing text accompaniments for your video content include:\n</p><ul>\n	<li><strong>Add the transcript as text on the page</strong>. You can simply add the transcription as text on the same page as the video, like this <a href=\"http://www.manythings.org/b/e/5000/\" target=\"_blank\">example of the coral reef video text below the video on the page</a>. You can type up the transcript yourself or use tools or services to do this for you (see resources section).</li>\n	<li><strong>HTML5 &lt;video&gt; and &lt;track&gt;</strong>. The HTML5 &lt;track&gt; tag on a &lt;video&gt; or &lt;audio&gt; element allows you to add video to your page and specify a .vtt text file with your transcription text. From what I can tell, Google can index .vtt files, but I don’t see any clear examples of Google associating a .vtt text file with the page that sources it for the video.</li>\n	<li><strong>Add an interactive transcript</strong>. Use a service that creates an interactive transcript, where the transcript is time-synced and can be used as navigation through the video, like these <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/amit_sood_every_piece_of_art_you_ve_ever_wanted_to_see_up_close_and_searchable/transcript?language=en\" target=\"_blank\">timed transcript TED talks</a>. </li>\n	<li><strong>YouTube transcripts, subtitles, and closed captions</strong> are automated by YouTube to various degrees of accuracy, but they’re incredibly convenient if you’re putting your video on YouTube. The automated transcription must be checked, though — it’s especially bad with accents, background noise, or this awesome example of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB8cSdgg_gI\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube’s automated transcript</a> of a video of the ChromeVox screen reader that, in the video, reads “image. Spacer image. Image. Caption icon off image. Internal link. Privacy slash security. Link. Sponsor image. Search index page description” but is transcribed as “en españa en carnac o móviles en china se dirigen al cómico jim carrey algo”.</li>\n</ul><p><img src=\"//d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/575640b93670b5.53101003.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of YouTube transcribing a video showing ChromeVox navigation as Spanish language text\">\n</p><h3>Video accessibility do’s and don’ts:</h3><ul>\n	<li><strong>Do provide video (and/or audio) transcripts</strong>. The time and effort it takes to provide text alternatives can help search engines and various viewers needing a text accompaniment to understand the content.</li>\n	<li><strong>Do upload or correct YouTube transcripts &amp; captions:</strong> YouTube’s automated transcripts are convenient but usually weird and wrong, and therefore need to be edited for correctness. Having the correct text is helpful for your transcript-dependent viewers and, when search engines do index the transcript text, that text content can help surface the video page in search results. </li>\n	<li><strong>Do provide context.</strong> When it makes sense (especially in closed captioning), indicate speaker names, and other sound context like music, relevant sounds, laughing, cheering, shouting, crying, etc. </li>\n	<li><strong>Don’t spam.</strong> Don’t use transcripts for keyword stuffing. It’s a terrible user experience, and depending on your platform, a transcript may not be indexed by search engines anyway, so keep it real.</li>\n</ul><h4>Video accessibility tools &amp; resources</h4><ul>\n	<li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734799?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Tips for creating a transcript file (YouTube)</a></li>\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.washington.edu/accessibility/videos/web/\" target=\"_blank\">Adding Captions to Videos on Web Pages</a></li>\n	<li><a href=\"http://www.uiaccess.com/transcripts/transcripts_on_the_web.html#justdoit\" target=\"_blank\">Transcripts on the Web: Getting people to your podcasts and videos</a></li>\n	<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/HTML/wiki/Media_Accessibility_Checklist\" target=\"_blank\">Media Accessibility Checklist</a></li>\n	<li><a href=\"http://alistapart.com/article/deafnessandtheuserexperience\" target=\"_blank\">Deafness and the User Experience</a></li>\n	<li>Transcription tool and services (there are <em>many</em>):\n	<ul>\n		<li><a href=\"http://amara.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Amara volunteer or paid transcription services</a></li>\n		<li><a href=\"https://wistia.com/doc/captions\" target=\"_blank\">Wistia captioning</a></li>\n		<li><a href=\"http://www.3playmedia.com/services-features/plugins/interactive-transcript/\" target=\"_blank\">3Play interactive captioning</a></li>\n		<li><a href=\"http://www.protranscript.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ProTranscript basic or interactive transcription</a></li>\n		<li><a href=\"http://www.speakertext.com/captionbox\" target=\"_blank\">CaptionBox interactive transcripts</a> (has WordPress plugin)</li>\n		<li><a href=\"http://www.subply.com/en/Products/InterActiveTranscript.htm\" target=\"_blank\">SubPLY embeddable, customizable, interactive transcripts</a></li>\n		<li><a href=\"https://dotsub.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dotsub captioning &amp; translation</a></li>\n		<li>YouTube: Upload your video, download the automated transcription, and then edit the transcription to use it wherever you intend to use it.</li>\n		<li>Speech recognition software.

	(3,'\n          <p class=\"text-light-gray\">[Estimated read time: 7 minutes]\n</p> <p>Every SEO knows 301 redirects are necessary from time to time. But are they affecting your other optimization efforts by slowing down page load time? Or are they sending bots on a wild goose chase? How many 301s are out there that you don’t need anymore?<br>\n</p><p>Before I jump into this list, let me take you back to where this started: I was in a development meeting for one of our clients. This meeting had nothing to do with SEO. But, as usual, the discussion quickly sparked a few SEO considerations.\n</p><p>This client, a manufacturer of home goods, is particularly sensitive about the load time of their site, and rightfully so. They’ve got a lot of hi-resolution imagery on their site; therefore, every possible measure to minimize load time must be taken.\n</p><p>One of the proposed initiatives to cut load time was removing all 301 redirects. That got my attention.\n</p><p>There was no way I was going to let that happen. I knew some of their redirects were necessary for — well, scratch that. I wasn’t sure how valuable they were or how many people were hitting them. I had no quantitative data to support my position.\n</p><p>I convinced them to leave all redirects in place until a viable solution was put in place. I obviously needed to collect some data to demonstrate how important 301 redirects can be. But how was I going to identify which ones needed to stay?\n</p><p>I wanted a solution that would provide the data in a format that we (as the marketers/analysts) could easily access without stepping on the toes of development or IT.\n</p><p>Google Analytics was the obvious choice. As I was hashing out the solution for the redirect removal conundrum (details on this in No. 3 below), I noticed several other items that were affecting the load time of this site: internal links pointing to outdated URLs (which had then been 301’ed) and rel=canonicals with 301’ed URLs.\n</p><p>Basically, every redirect-related issue that could exist did.\n</p><p>After fixing these issues, we were able to effectively decrease the redirection time of the site.\n</p><p>The development team was stoked, the SEO team was excited that our (necessary] 301s got to stay, and the client was thrilled with load time.\n</p><p>These changes were put into place between July and August of 2015. I think the results speak for themselves:\n</p><p><img src=\"https://d2v4zi8pl64nxt.cloudfront.net/heres-how-to-keep-301-redirects-from-ruining-your-seo-/574dc5d65faa40.18073611.jpg\" alt=\"574dc5d65faa40.18073611.jpg\">\n</p><p>Here are the four ways redirects could be hurting your SEO efforts:\n</p><p>1. You have redirect chains<br>2. Your internal linking steps through redirects<br>3. You have unnecessary 301s<br>4. You have canonical tags that 301\n</p><h2>1. You have redirect chains</h2><p>Let’s start out with a simple definition: A redirect chain is a series of redirects that go from one URL after another, forcing people and search engines to wait until there are no more redirects to step through. Here’s an example: www.mysite.com/responsive redirects to www.mysite.com/responsive-web-design, which then redirects to www.mysite.com/rwd.\n</p><p>Of course, we all know the implication this has on passing authority. For every step in a redirect chain, about 10% of authority is lost. But it’s also important to acknowledge how this would drastically increase page load time and decrease the overall quality of your site. A standard single-step redirect is already having an impact on your load time, then add to that the fact that some redirects may be going through multiple iterations just to call one URL.\n</p><p>It\'s no surprise that 301s stack up over time and create these chains: You put in this redirect, your coworker adds another, and a few months later you stack another one on top. These things happen.\n</p><p>So how do you identify these chains? Luckily, our friends at Screaming Frog have built ridiculously simple feature into their tool that tracks down redirect chains and outputs them in a report. Here\'s how to use it:\n</p><ul>\n	<li>Run a full site crawl with Screaming Frog</li>\n	<li>Go to &gt; Reports &gt; Redirect Chains</li>\n</ul><p><img src=\"https://d2v4zi8pl64nxt.cloudfront.net/heres-how-to-keep-301-redirects-from-ruining-your-seo-/574dc5d6ca6969.81355642.jpg\" alt=\"574dc5d6ca6969.81355642.jpg\">\n</p><p>That’s it. Seriously.\n</p><p>Analyzing which ones you need to fix is <i>slightly</i> more involved than pulling the report. The only thing that makes this more difficult is the fact that ALL of the links on your site are factored in. This means that if you link out to another site and they’ve got a chain in place, it finds that as well (see red highlighting in the screenshot below). One of the common themes of URL types I’ve seen here is social sharing URLs; they change frequently, so they’ll need to be filtered out of the report. In column B, identify your own domain (see green highlighting) and remove all the other rows.\n</p><p><img src=\"https://d2v4zi8pl64nxt.cloudfront.net/heres-how-to-keep-301-redirects-from-ruining-your-seo-/574dc5d7374d19.24218699.jpg\" alt=\"574dc5d7374d19.24218699.jpg\">\n</p><p>Once this is done, it’s pretty smooth sailing and you can update your 301 redirects to remove those unnecessary steps. Don’t send them to your dev or IT team yet, though. Keep reading for more useful nuggets.<br>\n</p><h2>2. Your internal linking steps through redirects</h2><p>The second way redirects could be hurting your SEO efforts is via internal links pointing to URLs that are redirected elsewhere.\n</p><p>To get a handle on what\'s going on with your site, follow these simple tips:\n</p><ul>\n	<li>Visit the Google Search Console and download the full list of your internal links.</li>\n	<li>Go to Search Traffic &gt; Internal Links and click the \"Download this Table\" button. Once you’ve done that, open the doc and use the concatenate function in Excel to append your domain to the beginning of those URL strings.</li>\n</ul><p>Once you have that column of your full URLs, copy the whole list. Here\'s how to use that clipboard info to populate a crawl in Screaming Frog:\n</p><ul>\n	<li>In the menu bar, go to \"Mode\" and change it to \"List.\" Then, click \"Upload List\" and \"Paste.\" This will run a crawl of only the URLs from the Internal Link report.</li>\n	<li>Once complete, check the status code column for any 301s. If you see any, select that URL and go to the Inlinks tab in the lower left of Screaming Frog. This will show you all the pages that contain a link to that redirecting URL.</li>\n</ul><p><img src=\"https://d2v4zi8pl64nxt.cloudfront.net/heres-how-to-keep-301-redirects-from-ruining-your-seo-/574dc5d79c5ed8.34090099.jpg\" alt=\"574dc5d79c5ed8.34090099.jpg\">\n</p><p>Once you’ve identified all redirecting internal links, get your list together for updates to send over to your development team.<br>\n</p><h2>3. You have unnecessary 301 redirects</h2><p>Websites tend to collect 301 redirects over the years, and no one really thinks to clean them up. When your .htaccess file starts to run deep with redirects, your load time suffers. Each time a URL is called by a browser, every single one of those redirects is checked to see if the requested URL needs to be sent elsewhere. The absolutely kills your load time.\n</p><p>But how do you identify which of those redirects are actually needed? UTM tags, that’s how.\n</p><p>By appending UTMs to the resolving URLs of redirects, you can easily identify which 301 redirects are actually used on a regular basis.\n</p><p>Here’s an example of the tagging methodology I use:\n</p><p><strong>/old-page &gt;&gt;&gt; /new-page?utm_medium=301&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_campaign=/old-page</strong>\n</p><p>This will send data to Google Analytics every time someone hits one of your redirects and give it the attribution information you’ve included in your UTMs.\n</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EsPI4phos1Wde7TjCKuitXcQ2rFvjAgaIydhNJ_pA1c/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">Download a Google Sheet with my tag generator</a>. To save it locally, go to File &gt; Download As &gt; Microsoft Excel (.xlsx).\n</p><p>Twice a year, I’ll go into Google Analytics and view the Source/Medium Report and apply an in-line filter for 301s.\n</p><p>From here, simply pull a list of redirects that were triggered and compare that to the list of 301s in the .htaccess file. Any that weren’t hit should get removed.\n</p><p><img src=\"http://imgur.com/1i2uvaD.jpg\" alt=\"1i2uvaD.jpg\">\n</p><p><em><strong>Side note: If you run an e-commerce site, you can demonstrate the importance of 301 redirects by showing how much revenue was saved by having redirects in place.</strong></em>\n</p><h2>4. You have canonical tags that 301</h2><p>The logic behind this one requires little explanation, as it’s basically the same as having redirect chains. You don’t want to have canonical tags that point to redirected URLs. To identify these canonical tags, run your Screaming Frog crawl and go to the Directives tab. Scroll to the right to find the \"Canonical Link Element 1\" column and copy the list.\n</p><p>Re-crawl using List Mode and find any that have a Status of 301.\n</p><p><img src=\"http://imgur.com/33fkRHg.jpg\" alt=\"33fkRHg.jpg\">\n</p><h2>Bonus: Regaining links via 301s</h2><p>If you have a large site, or your site has had a few URL structural changes over the years, chances are pretty good you’ve got some decent links pointing to a dead URL.\n</p><p>Run an Open Site Explorer report and grab the list of target URLs.\n</p><p>Drop that list into Screaming Frog using the same \"Upload List\" method described above. If you see any errors in the Status Code column, 301 redirect the URLs. (Make certain to check the stats and quality of those links first.)\n</p><p>Join in the conversation below if you have other redirect-related issues to add to this list, or other methods for identifying and troubleshooting these problems.\n</p>        ','https://moz.com/blog/heres-how-to-keep-301-redirects-from-ruining-your-seo'),

So if you are writing a blog, there are a bunch of things that you need to do to be great at SEO, and there are some steps that I think you can follow.\n</p>\n<p>This is not one of those things where I\'m going to say, \"Oh, you absolutely have to follow this from end to end for every post that you write, and it\'s a big, formal, complex process.\" A lot of this can be done in your head before you start writing the post, before you start creating it. That\'s totally okay. This does not have to add a ton of layers of involvement. But if you use this process as you\'re creating each post, which I do many, many times for Whiteboard Friday, this blog post that you\'re reading and watching right now, and for all the posts that I write, it can be hugely helpful and eventually transformative in your ability to get search traffic to your blog.\n</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Determine the post\'s goals</h2>\n<p>So let\'s start. First off, as you should always do, you should determine what the goal of the post is. You should have that in your head or written down before you start creating the post. So that could be:\n</p>\n<ul>\n	<li>Attract a new audience in this particular sphere.</li>\n	<li>Convince and win over people to my perspective on a particular topic.</li>\n	<li>I\'m really trying to promote a product or service with this post.</li>\n	<li>Share some important news about my organization or my company.</li>\n	<li>Share something that\'s happening in my sphere.</li>\n	<li>Contributing to a conversation that already exists out in the blogosphere or the social media world or the news world in your space. </li>\n	<li>Answer a question or earn influencer amplification. </li>\n</ul>Whatever it is, make sure you know what it is before you go into the post. I hate to see folks starting with step three, like doing keyword research when they have no idea what the post goals are.\n<p><br>One thing before we skip to step two is once you know what you\'re trying to do here, determine the metric or metrics that matter the most to that goal. So for example, a metric could be visits, just raw traffic. It could be engagement on the post. It could be comments. It could be links.\n</p>\n<p>It could be social shares, because you\'re trying to reach a new audience that\'s on LinkedIn. You haven\'t done very well on LinkedIn in the past, but you think this post is perfectly targeted to that.\n</p>\n<p>Or you\'re only really trying to get one or two people\'s attention, particular influencers, in which case your metric might be: Did they come and read it? Did they share it? If the answer to that is yes, you\'ve accomplished the post\'s goals. But you need that metric recorded.\n</p>\n<h2>Step 2: Determine the audience you need to reach</h2>\n<p><img src=\"//d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/5750e39caaca35.23348777.jpg\" rel=\"box-shadow: 0 0 10px 0 #999; border-radius: 20px;\" style=\"box-shadow: 0 0 10px 0 #999; border-radius: 20px;\">\n</p><strong></strong><strong></strong>\n<p>Related, determine the audience you\'re trying to reach with the post. So that could be potential new readers. It could be existing loyal fans. \"Yay,\" he\'s waving a flag. It could be influencers, folks who have the ability to broadcast your message, and maybe you\'re not even trying to attract them to broadcast this particular message, you just want their attention so in the future you can reach them.\n</p>\n<p>Or it might be very specific audience targets, in this case my backpacker readers. Moz does that all the time. For example, I might do a Whiteboard Friday that is specifically for e-commerce websites or specifically for B2B folks. I\'m focusing on a particular audience target with that content.\n</p>\n<h2>Step 3: Do your keyword research</h2>\n<p>Now we\'re going to do our keyword research, because we know what we\'re trying to accomplish and who we\'re trying to reach. So we\'re going to try and <strong>find three to five keyword phrases to target</strong>. Why three to five? Because generally, that\'s what you can reasonably expect to be able to reach with a single blog post. I\'ll talk a little bit more about on-page optimization in a sec.\n</p>\n<p>I\'m looking for, as we\'ve talked about in our <a href=\"https://moz.com/blog/discovering-prioritizing-best-keywords-whiteboard-friday\" target=\"_blank\">keyword research-focused Whiteboard Friday</a> just a few weeks ago, which you should check out if you haven\'t already, <strong>we want relatively high volume, low difficulty, high click-through rate opportunity</strong>. Meaning, there is a good number of people who search for it, it\'s not that hard to potentially rank for, and there are not too many other features in the search result that are going to take away from my potential ability to rank with web content.\n</p>\n<p>If there are, by the way, lots of people who have images or lots of people who have videos in this search result or lots of news content, then you want to think about, \"How do I get my post to include those?\" I might think about, \"Hey, maybe this post should be very visually centric, or maybe this post should be a video.\" \"Or maybe this post should try and get into Google News.\" \"Can I get my blog into Google News?\" If I can\'t, maybe I want to find someone whose platform I can publish on to get into Google News.\n</p>\n<p><strong>All the keywords that you target should have the same searcher intent</strong>. What do I mean by searcher intent? I mean that the people who search for those three to five terms and phrases are all trying to accomplish the same goal or very, very similar goals.\n</p>\n<p>So an example might be, if someone is searching for \"luxury kids clothes,\" that is likely very, very similar to someone searching for \"designer children\'s fashion,\" or \"haute couture kids brands.\" They all have the same intent. They are thinking about purchasing, or investigating at least what brands in the fashion space offer children\'s clothing, and they\'re all in the luxury, high-end, haute couture, high-priced space. Perfect. These are all matching that searcher intent.\n</p>\n<h2>Step 4: Conduct competitive research</h2>\n<p>I want to conduct my competitive research. This is where I\'m going to go ask questions like:\n</p>\n<ul>\n	<li><strong>\"Who else is ranking for this keyword?\"</strong> I can just go to Google, take a look at that, or I could look at the SERPs analysis through something like Keyword Explorer.</li>\n	<li><strong>\"Who has produced heavily shared content in this space?\"</strong> So not necessary who\'s ranking, but who\'s had lots of shares and likes on Facebook, on Twitter, on LinkedIn, on Pinterest, all that kind of stuff. BuzzSumo is great for this. You can also use Moz Content\'s Search tool. Once you know the answers to these two, you need to determine...</li>\n	<li><strong>\"What is it that\'s the unique value that I can bring to the table with my blog post?\" </strong>Unique value meaning not just unique content. Obviously, what you write is going to be different than what other people have written or created. But how are you providing value that is different from what other people have provided? </li>\n</ul>Is that because your opinions are very unique? Is it because you are providing a better experience? Is it because you\'re providing that content in a different format? Is it because you have access to unique researcher data? Whatever those things are, you need to answer that question because we\'re trying to go above and beyond what else is out there.\n<h2><strong>Step 5: Create your post</strong></h2>\n<p><img src=\"//d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/5750e3f532d615.97823520.jpg\" rel=\"box-shadow: 0 0 10px 0 #999; border-radius: 20px;\" style=\"box-shadow: 0 0 10px 0 #999; border-radius: 20px;\">\n</p>\n<p>I\'m going to go ahead and create the post, and this is where a lot of that research comes into play. Because I know what my post goals are and who I\'m targeting, and some of the keyword research and what people are looking for around this topic, as well as what\'s already out there, I can now make a post that is unique and uniquely valuable. This is huge, because it means that my post has much greater potential to reach its audience and to perform well, and to be perceived by both searchers and search engines, as well as sharers and influencers and folks on social media, as much more worthwhile. <br><br>I also want to think about, in here, the types of content that I want. So written content is pretty obvious for most blog posts. But I should also think about things like images and graphs or data, video. Do I want to embed content from other places, maybe SlideShare, or I want to embed some rich media file? <br><br>Or maybe I want to link to other places out there. Maybe some people have produced content on this and I would like to get their attention, and I would like to reference their work, and so I\'m going to link over to them. Maybe I want to embed some quotes or get some quotes from some notable folks about the particular topic or get other opinions for the piece. All of that type of stuff I should think about as I create the post. <br>\n</p>\n<h2><strong>Step 6: On-page SEO/keyword targeting </strong></h2>\n<p>This is the on-page SEO portion. So I\'m going to take those three to five terms, and I\'m going to think about one of those as the primary keyword phrase that I\'m targeting. That\'s going to be the one that goes exactly matched in the title and the headline and the URL. I\'m also going to think about two to four secondary keywords that I want to attempt to wrap into potentially the meta description and image alt tags and the content itself. I\'m going to try and use these keywords intelligently in places like <strong>title, URL, meta description, headline, content, images,</strong> all those spots.\n</p>\n<p>Then I want to consider any old URLs that I might redirect here. So let\'s say that perhaps I have done a blog post on this topic in the past six months ago or two years ago. Do I want to redirect that old post to this one? Or are there posts that I should go out there and find, or content anywhere on my site or on any site that I control or influence, where I want to link to this content, this new post that I\'m writing now that I\'ve created it? This can be helpful for discovery. It can also be helpful for internal linking, helpful to your audience who\'s reading your old stuff, and helpful to search engines to find, index, and hopefully rank your new content.\n</p>\n<h2><strong>Step 7: Craft an outreach + amplification plan</strong></h2>\n<p><img src=\"//d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/5750e269429e19.07847217.jpg\" rel=\"box-shadow: 0 0 10px 0 #999; border-radius: 20px;\" style=\"box-shadow: 0 0 10px 0 #999; border-radius: 20px;\">\n</p>\n<p>I need some way to do outreach and amplification, and I want to plan for that. So the questions I\'m asking here are:\n</p>\n<p><strong>Who</strong> do I want to reach? Who do I think will help me amplify this?\n</p>\n<p><strong>How</strong> am I going to target them? How am I going to reach out to them? Is it going to be via email? Is it going to be via Twitter? Am I going to see them in person? Do I have a direct relationship? Do I need an introduction? Do I want to comment on something that they have done, whatever that might be?\n</p>\n<p><strong>When</strong> should I do that? Do I want to do it beforehand, because I\'m trying to get them to look at the content or contribute something to it prior? Or do I want to do it after I\'ve published it and promoted it, and why?\n</p>\n<p>Meaning, <strong>why</strong> is this person going to help me? What does it do for them or for their audience? Does it make them look good? Is it something that in the past they have shared lots of things like this, but this one is uniquely valuable or better, or provides new information that they didn\'t have before? You need an answer to all of those questions when you create that plan.\n</p>\n<h2>Step 8: Experiment, learn, &amp; iterate</h2>\n<p><img src=\"//d1avok0lzls2w.cloudfront.net/uploads/blog/5750e2edea5db4.58925789.jpg\" rel=\"box-shadow: 0 0 10px 0 #999; border-radius: 20px;\" style=\"box-shadow: 0 0 10px 0 #999; border-radius: 20px;\">\n</p>\n<p>I\'m going to experiment, I\'m going to learn, and I\'m going to iterate on this. So look, in this process, some of these things, for a big, big post you might spend a lot of time on each of these steps very thoroughly. For a post that\'s sort of a toss-away, quick opinion, I\'m trying to write it in an hour or less and get it published, maybe I\'m just thinking about these things in my head and doing real fast keyword research and targeting, and the rest of it\'s sort of just a mental model that I have. But regardless of that, I\'m going to expect that this process is going to be repeated dozens of times, 30, 40, 50, 70 times even, before I should expect my first success, especially if you\'re a new blog or new blogger, and that I\'m going to have to do it hundreds of times before I\'ll have a relatively high hit or a high success rate, where lots of your posts are doing well and earning you rankings and ongoing traffic and social shares.<br><br>This is not something where you follow this process and you have instant results with your first post. That\'s not the case. No one has that in blogging. That\'s just not how it works. You\'re going to launch, promote, analyze, apply the information that you learn, and launch again. This process is going to happen over and over, and the more you learn and apply, the better you\'re going to get at this system. <br><br>All right, everyone. Hope you\'ve enjoyed this edition of Whiteboard Friday, and we will see you again next week. Take care. <br>\n</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.speechpad.com/page/video-transcription/\" target=\"_blank\">Video transcription</a> by <a href=\"http://www.speechpad.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Speechpad.com</a><br>\n</p>        ','https://moz.com/blog/seo-for-bloggers-whiteboard-friday'),
	(5,'\n							<p>Hillary Clinton became the first female candidate to clinch the presidential nomination of a major political party, 96 years after women won the right to vote.</p>\n<p>“Some of us are just terribly moved by this moment,” said Judith Hope, 76, the first female head of the New York Democratic Party, who founded the Eleanor Roosevelt Legacy Committee. “The significance of this cannot be overstated.</p>\n<p>“When my mother was born, women did not have the right to vote, so we’ve come, in really just a few generations, having to fight for the right to vote to finally a potential woman head of state.’’</p>\n<p>As for how Mrs. Roosevelt would react to Clinton’s success, “It just gives me goosebumps to think about what she would say,’’ Hope said.</p>\n<p>The two daughters of late former vice presidential hopeful Geraldine Ferraro said their mom would be “thrilled’’ to see Clinton on the November ballot, too.</p>\n<p>Ferraro, who was from New York City, made history as the first woman nominated for national office by a major party when she became running mate to Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale in 1984.</p>\n<p><a class=\"alignright post-image\" href=\"https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/postcover.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;strip=all\"><a class=\"modal-trigger\">Modal Trigger</a><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-10229710 size-medium\" src=\"https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/postcover.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=282&amp;strip=all\" width=\"282\" height=\"300\" style=\"cursor: default;\"></a></p>\n<p>She and Mondale lost in a landslide to Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, but Ferraro remained a major female role model. She died in 2011 at age 75.</p>\n<p>“I wish I could obviously celebrate with my mother because it is such an exciting milestone — I know she wanted it to happen in her lifetime,’’ Laura Lee, Ferraro’s younger daughter, said of Hillary’s expected nomination.</p>\n<p>“I think it surprised her that it didn’t happen before she passed away, that it was taking so long,’’ said Lee, a pediatrician in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>“For me, it’s incredibly meaningful,’’ she added. “Ironically, I almost think it’s more meaningful than when I pulled the lever to vote for my mother at age 18.</p>\n<p>“I was only 18 years old, and I know I didn’t have an appreciation for the gender gap and the glass ceiling. Now, I feel like I have much more insight.’’</p>\n<p>Ferraro’s other daughter, documentary filmmaker Donna Ullman, 52, of Manhattan, added, “People said that in 1984, when they saw my mother up there [on the podium], that it changed what they thought was possible.”</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_10229094\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/538707946.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;strip=all\" class=\"post-image\"><a class=\"modal-trigger\">Modal Trigger</a><img class=\"wp-image-10229094 \" src=\"https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/538707946.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=350&amp;strip=all\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" style=\"cursor: default;\"></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"credit\">Photo: Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Clinton is not the first woman to run for president.

	(6,'\n							<p>A week ago, <a href=\"http://nypost.com/tag/Donald-Trump\">Donald Trump</a> declared war on the news media. This week, <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/06/03/donald-jurists-mexican-heritage-is-conflict-in-trump-u-case/\">he’s in a death-cage match with the judge presiding over the lawsuit against the defunct Trump University</a>. He’s also fighting Republicans <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/06/07/ryan-slams-trump-over-his-racist-comment-about-american-judge/\">who think he’s out of line</a>.</p>\n<p>Maybe next week, Trump will get around to taking on <a href=\"http://nypost.com/tag/Hillary-Clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>. Or maybe not, depending on his obsession of the moment.</p>\n<p>Having secured the nomination, Trump now seems determined to lose the general election. If that’s his goal, he’s on a path to success.</p>\n<p>If, on the other hand, he actually wants to win the White House, there are some obvious things to talk about, including jobs and the economy. Not included is taking the campaign down rabbit holes that are irrelevant to most voters.</p>\n<p>No, Trump’s criticism of the judge is not racism by any definition. But it is strategically dumb and self-defeating.</p>\n<p>This is hardly the first time Trump has flirted with disaster, and earlier predictions of his demise were premature. But playing demolition derby with a large field of Republican rivals was the minor leagues compared with facing off against Clinton. There is little margin for errors, and none for compounding them.</p>\n<p>Especially now, when Clinton is about to consolidate the Democratic Party behind her, the contrast will be stark. She’ll be basking in gushy coverage about the “historic moment” of the first woman becoming the presidential nominee of a major party, while he’s bickering with just about everybody, including supporters, over the judge.</p>\n<p>His flame-throwing at the media was in response to critical stories about how much money he raised for veterans groups, an issue he created way back when the campaign was in Iowa. When he didn’t get the praise he wanted, he went ballistic.</p>\n<p>The attack on the federal judge is more of the same. Judge Gonzalo Curiel has ruled against him in some pretrial issues, and Trump responded by saying the judge couldn’t be fair because he is the son of Mexican immigrants and Trump has taken a hard line on illegal immigration.</p>\n<p>Even if Trump has the kernel of a point in both cases, so what? How does either issue help Americans who are looking for a job and a reason to believe in the nation’s future again? It doesn’t, and that’s why Trump is wrong to elevate his feuds.</p>\n<p>Clinton, meanwhile, had her own problems, but they didn’t do her much new damage. The blistering report from the State Department’s inspector general <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/05/25/state-department-faults-clinton-for-emails-and-cybersecurity-risks/\">marked the first time a government agency faulted her handling of email</a> and the home-brew server, but Trump was too busy shadowboxing with the press to exploit the opportunity.</p>\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/06/03/ugly-jobs-report-is-even-worse-than-it-looks/\">the rotten jobs report</a> undercuts Clinton’s defense of the Obama economy, but again, the moment passed. And while <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/06/05/sanders-makes-rare-dig-at-clinton-over-foreign-donations/\">Bernie Sanders is growing more critical of Clinton</a> and her team as being heavy-handed in trying to force him out of the race before the convention, Trump is not in a position to benefit.</p>\n<p>In fairness, the Republican did mention both the IG report and the jobs debacle, but his inflammatory attacks on the press and the judge got the bulk of attention. He gave the news media the rope, and they promptly hanged him.</p>\n<p>If he wants to try to remove Judge Curiel, his lawyers should go to court to make their case, which seems to be based on the judge’s heritage and his membership in Latino advocacy organizations. But by injecting the court case into the campaign, and letting it dominate for days, Trump turned a minor issue into a political crisis.</p>\n<p>Although House Speaker <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/06/07/ryan-slams-trump-over-his-racist-comment-about-american-judge/\">Paul Ryan went way overboard</a> by saying that Trump’s remarks are “sort of like the textbook definition of a racist comment,” it’s hardly a secret that Ryan is skittish, despite saying he would vote for Trump. He’s always ready to pounce, so Trump shouldn’t give him an excuse.</p>\n<p>The combination of Trump’s mistakes and Clinton’s seizing the nomination is likely to give Clinton a bounce in the polls, reversing Trump’s momentum. Recent national surveys and in key swing states showed a dead heat, and oddsmakers had raised Trump’s chance of winning to about 1-in-3.</p>\n<p>That would still make him a loser in November, so it’s hard to explain why he thinks he has the luxury of engaging in destructive sideshows. Before he pops off again, he ought to remember those Americans who have been ignored by both parties and are counting on him. Maybe then he’ll take on the fights that matter.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you’ve never been to a Trump Rally, be prepared to drink the Kool-Aid or get the boot:&nbsp; </strong></em></p><div

both to improve education and settle political scores with Mayor Bill de Blasio. But there’s a better solution.</p>\n<p>The cost of an added bureaucracy is reason alone to scuttle the idea of a state inspector. Equally important, the trend toward relying on Big Brother supervision must stop.</p>\n<p>Whether it’s the Justice Department micromanaging police departments, or the federal Department of Education enforcing bathroom rules that favor transgender students, local control of public services is being eroded.</p>\n<p>Already, the NYPD and FDNY have court-ordered monitors, and consent decrees the city signed during the Koch administration still drive up costs in homeless services.</p>\n<p>Mayoral control of schools was the goal for a generation, and Albany finally came around during Michael Bloomberg’s tenure. Unfortunately, de Blasio ceded control to the teachers unions and “social justice” advocates, with education taking a back seat.</p>\n<p>Albany isn’t the answer. It can’t fix its own ethics, and state educrats aren’t exactly world renowned. Besides, there is already plenty of power for officials to set higher standards and require local districts to meet them.</p>\n<p>As for de Blasio, the solution isn’t a shorter leash. It’s a better mayor.</p>\n<h3>What a hole lot of hooey</h3>\n<p>There’s spin, and there’s fantasy. City Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg is guilty of the latter, claiming in a press release: “DOT work crews, from those producing asphalt to those putting it down on our roads, deserve serious credit for stepping up to keep our roadways smoothly paved and safe. Because of their hard work, New Yorkers are both enjoying smooth rides and noticing fewer potholes, with complaints down by almost 50 percent this year.”</p>\n<p>Smooth rides? It’s more likely that potholes swallowed those missing complainers.</p>\n<h3>Bam has Bibi Russian for cover</h3>\n<p>Here’s an attention-getter: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russia’s Vladimir Putin just concluded their fourth meeting in less than a year.</p>\n<p>The Times of Israel reports that the two-day summit in Moscow marked 25 years of diplomatic ties, leading Netanyahu to say, “In another 25 years, when they look back, they will remember this evening as a turning point in our ties.”</p>\n<p>Who can blame him? With President Obama turning his back, Israel needs new friends. Again and everywhere, the vacuum Obama leaves is filled by our adversaries.</p>\n','http://nypost.com/2016/06/07/donald-trump-is-doing-a-great-job-if-hes-trying-to-lose/'),

Many see her as emblematic of a political system corrupted by corporate influence and the beneficiary of a Democratic establishment that has conspired to ensure she becomes the nominee.</p>\n<p>When Sanders mentioned that he had received a “very gracious call” from Clinton, and congratulated her on her primary wins, the crowd erupted in boos until he raised his hand as if to quieten them. </p>\n<p>“Our fight is to transform this country and to understand that we are in this together,” Sanders said.</p>\n<h2>Trump tries to lure Sanders supporters</h2>\n<p>Trump, who like Sanders is an anti-establishment candidate who ostensibly claimed to eschew money from corporate interests and lambasted America’s trade deals, immediately moved to lure some of his disaffected supporters. </p>\n<div id=\"dfp-ad--inline2\" data-link-name=\"ad slot inline2\" data-test-id=\"ad-slot-inline2\" data-name=\"inline2\" data-mobile=\"1,1|300,250\" data-mobile-landscape=\"1,1|300,250\" data-tablet=\"1,1|300,250\" class=\"js-ad-slot ad-slot ad-slot--dfp ad-slot--inline ad-slot--inline2\" data-node-uid=\"20\"></div><p>Appearing at a news conference at his golf club in Westchester, New York, Trump said he had reached his own historic milestone, receiving “more votes than any other GOP campaign in history”, and made a direct appeal to Sanders voters.</p>\n<p>“The terrible trade deals that Bernie was so vehemently against – and he’s right on that – will be taken care of far better than anyone ever thought possible,” Trump said. “For all of those <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" class=\"u-underline\">Bernie Sanders</a> voters who will be left out in the cold by a rigged system of superdelegates, we welcome you with open arms.”</p>\n<p>For months, Sanders and his backers have complained about the role of superdelegates, who are party officials that are granted a vote at the convention in July, where the party’s nominee is formally appointed.</p>\n<p>Sanders supporters were furious on Monday when the Associated Press and other media outlets declared Clinton the presumptive nominee after she quietly acquired a slew of new superdelegate supporters. The Sanders campaign dismissed the declaration as premature, pointing out that those superdelegates could change their mind before the convention.</p>\n<p>It was unclear late on Tuesday whether Clinton would clinch the nomination with pledged delegates alone. </p>\n<p>However, her majority in pledged delegates undercut Sanders’ principal argument; if he is to become the nominee, it is now the Vermont senator who would need the help of party officials to overrule the popular will of voters and reach the 2,383 delegates needed.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, at least, Sanders appeared undeterred, arguing he had won 22 state contests and received more than 10m votes. “I am pretty good in arithmetic, and I know the fight in front of us is a very, very steep fight,” he said. “But we will continue to fight for every vote and every delegate.”</p>\n<figure class=\"element element-video fig--has-shares fig--narrow-caption\"

However on Wednesday, European investigators claimed Mered was one of the key players along a route that sends migrants from Khartoum, through the Sahara to the Libyan coast, and then onwards to southern Italy.</p>\n<p>One of the Italian prosecutors investigating Mered, Francesco Lo Voi, said Italy had seized “the boss of one of the most important criminal groups operating in central <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/africa\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" class=\"u-underline\">Africa</a> and Libya”.</p>\n<p>Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA), which was involved in the investigation, <a href=\"http://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/869-prolific-people-smuggler-captured-in-sudan\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"in-body-link\" class=\"u-underline\">hailed the capture</a> of “one of the world’s most wanted people-smugglers”.</p>\n<p>In a separate development on Wednesday, a UN inquiry accused the Eritrean government of <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=20067&amp;LangID=E\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"in-body-link\" class=\"u-underline\">crimes against humanity</a>, and of enslaving up to 400,000 of its citizens. The claims are denied by the Eritrean information ministry, but help explain why so many Eritreans have been driven into the hands of smugglers like Mered.</p>\n<p>More than 320,000 people reached Italy from Libya in 2014 and 2015, including about 70,000 Eritreans. By his account, Mered had a hand in roughly 4% of this market.</p>\n<p>“He admitted to smuggling 13,000 people,” said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/29/eritrean-refugee-radio-hotline-erena-winter\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"in-body-link\" class=\"u-underline\">Meron Estefanos, an Eritrean broadcast journalist and activist</a>, who interviewed Mered by telephone as part of her research into the treatment of Eritrean refugees in north Africa. “I have never seen any [Eritrean smuggler] become as big as him so quickly.”</p>\n<p>In his interview with Estefanos, Mered suggested that he did not have a practical role in the transportation of migrants across the Mediterranean. Instead he said he acted more as a middleman, working under the protection of Libyan and Sudanese officials and smugglers, to whom he supplied a constant flow of passengers. They then organised the logistics of moving people across seas and deserts, in exchange for a large cut of his profits.</p>\n<p>“The [Eritrean] smugglers are fixers,” said Estefanos. “Medhanie told me he’s never set foot on the shore.”</p>\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--upgraded\" data-component=\"rich-link\" data-link-name=\"rich-link-3 | 2\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"rich-link tone-feature--item \">\n\n    <div class=\"rich-link__container\">\n        \n            \n                \n\n                    <div class=\"rich-link__image-container u-responsive-ratio\">\n                        <img src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a3b390ac430088750fc5f04e5624b7eacadc26d/0_0_4468_2682/master/4468.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=f4f6aafe45032c29b762a2b0fb55efd9\" itemprop=\"contentURL\">\n                    </div>\n                \n            \n        \n\n        <div class=\"rich-link__header\">\n            <h1 class=\"rich-link__title\">\n                \n                <a class=\"rich-link__link\">On the road in Agadez: desperation and death along a Saharan smuggling route</a>\n            </h1>\n            \n            \n        </div>\n\n        \n            <div class=\"rich-link__standfirst u-cf\">\n                 As political leaders prepare to meet in Malta to discuss measures to stem the flow of migrants and refugees from Africa to Europe, <strong>Patrick Kingsley </strong>meets the smugglers and the smuggled on a route through the desert from Niger  \n            </div>\n            \n            \n        \n\n        <div class=\"rich-link__read-more\">\n            <div class=\"rich-link__arrow\">\n                <svg width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g fill=\"none\" fill-rule=\"evenodd\"><path class=\"rich-link__arrow-icon\" d=\"m12 0c-6.627 0-12 5.373-12 12 0 6.627 5.373 12 12 12 6.627 0 12-5.373 12-12 0-6.627-5.373-12-12-12m.21 19l-.637-.668 4.888-6.326h-11.465v-1.01h11.465l-4.888-6.333.637-.668 6.79 7.158v.685l-6.79 7.157\"></path></g></svg>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"rich-link__read-more-text\">\n                Read more\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <a class=\"rich-link__link u-faux-block-link__overlay\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/09/on-the-road-in-agadez-desperation-and-death-along-a-saharan-smuggling-route\"></a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n</aside>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/29/refugee-rescue-ship-bourbon-argos-eritreans-libya-msf\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"in-body-link\" class=\"u-underline\">Guardian interviews with Eritrean refugees</a> suggest that Sudanese drivers carry Eritreans to the Libyan border, where they are crammed into trucks driven by Libyan smugglers, and taken on a hellish journey to north-eastern Libya.

Once a ransom is paid, refugees are judged to have settled their debts for the desert journey, and driven westwards to towns near Tripoli – where they are often ransomed again as advance payment for the Mediterranean journey.</p>\n<p>Italian wiretaps suggest that Mered played a role in the procurement of ransom payments from the Eritrean diaspora. They also record him explaining how he bribes Libyan policemen to release migrants held within detention centres – migrants he would then hold for ransom until their relatives paid him back for their release.</p>\n<p>All this made him “one of the four most important human smugglers in Africa and Libya,” said prosecutor Calogero Ferrara.</p>\n<p>But despite Mered’s allegedly prominent role, Libyan smugglers previously interviewed by the Guardian have been dismissive about the wider importance of sub-Saharan smugglers within their networks, and questioned how much impact foreigners would have in a country where migrants are treated as second-class citizens.</p>\n<div id=\"dfp-ad--inline2\" data-link-name=\"ad slot inline2\" data-test-id=\"ad-slot-inline2\" data-name=\"inline2\" data-mobile=\"1,1|300,250\" data-mobile-landscape=\"1,1|300,250\" data-tablet=\"1,1|300,250\" class=\"js-ad-slot ad-slot ad-slot--dfp ad-slot--inline ad-slot--inline2\" data-node-uid=\"10\"></div><p>“The Africans collect people for us, and they get their commission,” said Ahmed, a Libyan smuggler interviewed in 2015. “But it’s much less than the Libyans.

But he told Estefanos he hoped to reach Sweden, where his wife lived. Once he realised he might be arrested in Europe, he went to Sudan instead, where he was captured. Different reports suggest he had a mistress in either Holland or Sweden.</p>\n<p>Mered appeared to think he was invincible. “He wanted to be like [former Libyan leader Muammar] Gaddafi,” said Renato Cortese, a senior Italian policeman. “He said he was never going to be arrested.”</p>\n<p>But he was finally caught on 24 May at a friend’s house in Khartoum – and it was his carelessness on the phone that may have contributed to his downfall. “What’s so stupid about him is that he knew his phone was being tapped, but he never cared,” said Estefanos. “He always used the same number.”</p>\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail element-rich-link--upgraded\" data-component=\"rich-link\" data-link-name=\"rich-link-3 | 3\">\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"rich-link tone-feature--item \">\n\n    <div class=\"rich-link__container\">\n        \n            \n                \n\n                    <div class=\"rich-link__image-container u-responsive-ratio\">\n                        <img src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79f2c22178afc98e6a348d8f7f3e5c4a13175f3f/0_122_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=460&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=0c5eb3ba787b82d1bcd807cc4b51d82b\" itemprop=\"contentURL\">\n                    </div>\n                \n            \n        \n\n        <div class=\"rich-link__header\">\n            <h1 class=\"rich-link__title\">\n                \n                <a class=\"rich-link__link\">It\'s not at war, but up to 3% of its people have fled.

	(11,'\n				<p>The last step in an online buying process is always the checkout page; your website’s cash register. It consists of a number of steps that lead to a completion of a purchase. In this post, we’ll discuss the things you can improve, from the UX of your shopping cart to a thank you page. We’ll tell you how to make your visitor as comfortable as possible.</p>\n<p><em>Please realize that conversion and checkout page UX go hand in hand. Improving the UX of your checkout process will influence conversion as well.</em></p>\n<h2>Progress bar</h2>\n<p>One of the most important things to realize is that checkout page UX is actually about optimizing every single step (page) in the checkout <em>process</em>. Before going into detail, I’d like to mention your visitors’ best friend in the checkout process: the progress bar. It makes it visible for visitors how far along they are in the process. This actually results in <a href=\"http://www.shopify.com/blog/7988857-how-to-use-gamification-to-increase-sales\" onclick=\"__gaTracker(\'send\', \'event\', \'outbound-article\', \'http://www.shopify.com/blog/7988857-how-to-use-gamification-to-increase-sales\', \'gamification\');\">gamification</a>, which makes it even more likely they’ll finish the entire process.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-735741\" src=\"https://cdn-images.yoast.com/uploads/2016/05/checkout-yoast_1CF5DF5B-600x101.png\" alt=\"Checkout Optimization at Yoast: progress bar\" width=\"600\" height=\"101\" srcset=\"https://cdn-images.yoast.com/uploads/2016/05/checkout-yoast_1CF5DF5B-600x101.png 600w, https://cdn-images.yoast.com/uploads/2016/05/checkout-yoast_1CF5DF5B-250x42.png 250w, https://cdn-images.yoast.com/uploads/2016/05/checkout-yoast_1CF5DF5B-768x129.png 768w, https://cdn-images.yoast.com/uploads/2016/05/checkout-yoast_1CF5DF5B.png 1019w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></p>\n<p>At Yoast, we added a little motivational twist to improve the UX of our checkout page: a potential buyer starts in step 2 of the process. Step one is clicking the buy button and he has already done that, right? That deserves validation as well ;) Starting in step 2 is like giving them a head start and will motivate them to complete the purchase.</p>\n<h2>Shopping cart overview</h2>\n<p>A very important aspect of your checkout page UX is the shopping cart overview. Regardless of what product you’re selling, we think every shopping cart overview should at least have these elements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Product images.</strong> These help a visitor remember what products they have added to the cart. Shopping takes time and this is just a friendly reminder.</li>\n<li><strong>Prices.</strong> Clearly state the price of an individual article, the amount per article and the total price.</li>\n<li><strong>Shipping (and other additional) costs</strong>. Prevent surprises. No additional costs after this point in the checkout process, as it will ruin any checkout page UX!</li>\n<li><strong>List of payment options.</strong> I actually think that payment options should be clear from the start, so from your product pages onwards. This will prevent disappointments like the need to use an authentication device when there is no around.</li>\n<li><strong>Security signs.</strong> Clearly state that all is done in a safe, secure environment, for instance by a clear SSL certificate and things like Symantec seals. Testimonials also help for social security.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All these things combined create an optimal checkout page UX: a feeling of trust and convenience that will invite the visitor to complete the purchase.<br>\n</p>','https://yoast.com/checkout-page-ux/'),

	(14,'\n				<p>WordPress security has always been food for thought. Even though most of the latest updates (including&nbsp;WordPress 4.5.2) deal with WordPress security issues, there is still a lot that can be done to improve that security, even by the less tech-savvy of us. In this article,&nbsp;I’d like to enumerate&nbsp;a number of suggestions on how to improve security on your own&nbsp;WordPress website.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn-images.yoast.com/uploads/2014/11/wordpress_security_FI.png\" onclick=\"__gaTracker(\'send\', \'event\', \'outbound-article\', \'https://cdn-images.yoast.com/uploads/2014/11/wordpress_security_FI.png\', \'\');\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-509737 featured-image\" src=\"https://cdn-images.yoast.com/uploads/2014/11/wordpress_security_FI-600x314.png\" alt=\"wordpress security must read article by yoast\" width=\"600\" height=\"314\" srcset=\"https://cdn-images.yoast.com/uploads/2014/11/wordpress_security_FI-600x314.png 600w, https://cdn-images.yoast.com/uploads/2014/11/wordpress_security_FI-250x131.png 250w, https://cdn-images.yoast.com/uploads/2014/11/wordpress_security_FI.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"></a></p>\n<h3><a class=\"toplink\" href=\"#top\"><i class=\"fa fa-level-up\"></i></a>Table of contents</h3>\n<ul class=\"toc\">\n<li><a href=\"#noadmin\">Don\'t use <code>admin</code> as a username</a></li><li><a href=\"#goodpasswords\">Use a less common password</a></li><li><a href=\"#twofactor\">Add Two-Factor Authentication</a></li><li><a href=\"#leastprivileged\">Employ Least Privileged principles</a></li><li><a href=\"#hidewpconfig\">Hide <code>wp-config.php</code> and <code>.htaccess</code></a></li><li><a href=\"#wpsecuritykeys\">Use WordPress security keys for authentication</a></li><li><a href=\"#disablefileediting\">Disable file editing</a></li><li><a href=\"#limitloginattempts\">Limit login attempts</a></li><li><a href=\"#xmlrpc\">Be selective with XML-RPC</a></li><li><a href=\"#hosting\">Hosting &amp;&nbsp;WordPress security</a></li><li><a href=\"#stayuptodate\">Stay up-to-date</a></li><li><a href=\"#pluginsthemes\">(Free) plugins &amp; themes</a></li><li><a href=\"#contactsucuri\">Contact Sucuri</a></li><li><a href=\"#closing\">Closing thoughts</a></li></ul>\n<p>WordPress itself has <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress\" onclick=\"__gaTracker(\'send\', \'event\', \'outbound-article\', \'http://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress\', \'a list\');\">a list</a> on&nbsp;WordPress security you might want to read.&nbsp;Of course, some of the things in that list will be repeated in the article below. Personally, I prefer a more hands on list and direction, that’s why we decided to write this&nbsp;article.</p>\n<h2 id=\"noadmin\"><a class=\"toplink\" href=\"#top\"><i class=\"fa fa-level-up\"></i></a>Don’t use <code>admin</code> as a username</h2>\n<p>Think about this. This is perhaps the easiest baseline step for WordPress security you can take as a WordPress user. It costs you nothing, and the install makes it really easy to do. A majority of today’s attacks target your wp-admin / wp-login access points using a combination of <em>admin</em> and some password in what is known as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack\" onclick=\"__gaTracker(\'send\', \'event\', \'outbound-article\', \'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack\', \'Brute Force attacks\');\">Brute Force attacks</a>. Common sense would dictate that if you remove <em>admin</em> you’ll also kill the attack outright.</p>\n<p>Yes, the argument exists that the attacker can still enumerate the user ID and Name and can in some instances pull the new username. There is no denying this. Remember though, like our friends at Sucuri like to say, <strong>Security is not about <em>risk elimination</em>, it’s about <em>risk reduction</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>For the everyday, automated Brute Force attack, removing the default <em>admin</em> or <em>administrator</em> username will already help a lot. You’re at least making it <em>a bit</em> harder for the hacker to guess the username. For the sake of clarity, understand that when we say <code>admin</code> we are speaking specifically to the username only and not the role.</p>\n<p>Simply create a new user in&nbsp;WordPress at Users &gt; New User and make that a user with Administrator rights. After that, delete the <code>admin</code> user. Don’t worry about the post or&nbsp;pages the admin user has already created.&nbsp;WordPress will nicely ask you: “What should be done with content owned by this user?” and give you the option to delete all content or assign it to a new user, like the one you have just created.</p>\n<h2 id=\"goodpasswords\"><a class=\"toplink\" href=\"#top\"><i class=\"fa fa-level-up\"></i></a>Use a less common password</h2>\n<p>An easy thing to remember is <strong>CLU</strong>: Complex. Long. Unique.</p>\n<p>This is where tools like <a href=\"https://agilebits.com/onepassword\" onclick=\"__gaTracker(\'send\', \'event\', \'outbound-article\', \'https://agilebits.com/onepassword\', \'1Password\');\">1Password</a> and <a href=\"https://lastpass.com/\" onclick=\"__gaTracker(\'send\', \'event\', \'outbound-article\', \'https://lastpass.com/\', \'LastPass\');\">LastPass</a> come into play, as they each have password generators. You type in the length, and it generates the password. You save the link, save the password, and move on with your day.&nbsp;Depending on how secure I want the password to be, I usually set length of the password (20 characters is <a href=\"https://howsecureismypassword.net/\" onclick=\"__gaTracker(\'send\', \'event\', \'outbound-article\', \'https://howsecureismypassword.net/\', \'always right\');\">always right</a>) and decide on things like the inclusion of less usual&nbsp;characters like # or *.</p>\n<p>‘123456’&nbsp;isn’t a password. ‘qwerty’ is like writing your security code&nbsp;on your bank card. ‘letmein’; seriously? <a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/splashdata-worst-passwords/\" onclick=\"__gaTracker(\'send\', \'event\', \'outbound-article\', \'http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/splashdata-worst-passwords/\', \'Shame on you\');\">Shame on you</a>. Even ‘starwars’ made the 2015 list of 25 most used passwords. Remember, you’re never as unique as you think you are…</p>\n<h2 id=\"twofactor\"><a class=\"toplink\" href=\"#top\"><i class=\"fa fa-level-up\"></i></a>Add Two-Factor Authentication</h2>\n<p>Even if you’re not using ‘admin’ and are using a strong, randomly generated password, Brute Force attacks can still be a problem. To address this, things like Two-Factor Authentication are key to helping to reduce the risk of such attacks.</p>\n<p>Oh, I know, the hassle two-factor authentication is. But for now, it’s&nbsp;your Fort Knox. The essence of two-factor authentication for WordPress security is exactly as implied in the name, two forms of authentication. It’s the recognized standard today for enhanced security at your access points. &nbsp;You are already using two-factor authentication for Gmail, Paypal, and the works (at least&nbsp;you should be), why not add it to your&nbsp;WordPress security toolkit as well. Ipstenu (Mika Epstein) did an article on the subject you might want to read: <a href=\"http://halfelf.org/2013/two-factor-authentication/\" onclick=\"__gaTracker(\'send\', \'event\', \'outbound-article\', \'http://halfelf.org/2013/two-factor-authentication/\', \'Two Factor Authentication\');\">Two Factor Authentication</a>.</p>\n<p>There is a plugin for that:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-authenticator/\" onclick=\"__gaTracker(\'send\', \'event\', \'outbound-article\', \'https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-authenticator/\', \'Google Authenticator\');\">Google Authenticator</a>.

Hosting companies simply <a href=\"http://perezbox.com/2014/11/how-hosts-manage-your-website-security/\" onclick=\"__gaTracker(\'send\', \'event\', \'outbound-article\', \'http://perezbox.com/2014/11/how-hosts-manage-your-website-security/\', \'see your website differently\');\">see your website differently</a>. There&nbsp;is no simple rule to decide on your <a href=\"https://yoast.com/articles/wordpress-hosting/\">WordPress hosting company.</a>&nbsp;But the choice of a hosting company does matter when optimizing your WordPress security.</p>\n<p>Every article written on hosting or hosting companies seems to start by telling you that the cheapest one is probably not the best one. Most cheaper hosting plans won’t have support to help you out with a hacked site. These plans include&nbsp;little to secure your website, like for instance set up a Website Firewall (more on the Sucuri Website Firewall later). Shared hosting, for instance, does imply that your hosting server is also populated with other websites. These might have security issues of&nbsp;their own, which in turn might affect your own website’s security as well.</p>\n<p>WordPress security seems to be one of the main USPs offered in&nbsp;specialized&nbsp;WordPress hosting products, like the one offered by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/hosting/wordpress-hosting.aspx\" onclick=\"__gaTracker(\'send\', \'event\', \'outbound-article\', \'https://www.godaddy.com/hosting/wordpress-hosting.aspx\', \'GoDaddy\');\">GoDaddy</a>. They offer backups, redundant firewalls, malware scanning and DDoS protection and automatic&nbsp;WordPress updates for very reasonable pricing (understatement).</p>\n<h3><a class=\"toplink\" href=\"#top\"><i class=\"fa fa-level-up\"></i></a>Be mindful of host account</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges with hosts is in their account configuration for website owners. Website owners are allowed to install and configure as many websites as they want, and this fosters “soup kitchen”-like environments.</p>\n<p>This is challenging because, in many instances, a website is compromised via a concept known as <em>cross-site contamination</em> in which a neighboring site is used as the attack vector. The attacker penetrates the server, then moves laterally into neighboring sites on the server.</p>\n<p>The best way to account for this is to create two accounts, one which you treat as a production environment – only live sites are published – and a staging one, in which you put everything else.</p>\n<h2 id=\"stayuptodate\"><a class=\"toplink\" href=\"#top\"><i class=\"fa fa-level-up\"></i></a>Stay up-to-date</h2>\n<p>Staying up-to-date is an easy statement to make, but for website owners in the day-to-day, we realize how hard this can be. Our websites are complex beings, we have 150 different things going at any given time, and sometimes it’s difficult to apply the changes quickly. A recent study shows that <a href=\"https://sucuri.net/website-security/website-hacked-report\" onclick=\"__gaTracker(\'send\', \'event\', \'outbound-article\', \'https://sucuri.net/website-security/website-hacked-report\', \'56% of WordPress installations were running out of date versions of core\');\">56% of WordPress installations were running out of date versions of core</a>.<br>\nUpdates need to extend beyond WordPress&nbsp;core. The same study shows that a very large percentage of the website hacks came from out-of-date, vulnerable, versions of plugins.</p>\n<p>This can be compounded in really complex environments in which dependencies make it so that backups can’t be achieved. This is why we personally employ <a href=\"https://sucuri.net/website-firewall/\" onclick=\"__gaTracker(\'send\', \'event\', \'outbound-article\', \'https://sucuri.net/website-firewall/\', \'Sucuri’s Firewall.\');\">Sucuri’s Firewall.</a>&nbsp;This firewall virtually patches and hardens our website at the edge. It gives us the time we require to go back and apply updates in a more reasonable time frame, allowing us to test in our staging environments first, and only then push to production.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pluginsthemes\"><a class=\"toplink\" href=\"#top\"><i class=\"fa fa-level-up\"></i></a>(Free) plugins &amp; themes</h2>\n<p>Most&nbsp;WordPress users tend to apply themes and plugins at will to their posts. Unless you’re doing this on a test server for the sole purpose of testing that theme or plugin, that makes no sense, especially not with reference to WordPress security. Most plugins and a lot of themes are free, and unless you have a solid business model to accompany these free giveaways. If a developer is&nbsp;maintaining a plugin just <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/12/12/joost-de-valk-the-victory-of-the-commons/\" onclick=\"__gaTracker(\'send\', \'event\', \'outbound-article\', \'http://wordpress.tv/2013/12/12/joost-de-valk-the-victory-of-the-commons/\', \'because it’s good fun\');\">because it’s good fun</a>, chances are he or she did not take the time to do proper security checks.</p>\n<p>We have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://yoast.com/regular-security-audits/\">teamed up with Sucuri</a>&nbsp;years ago, to make sure every plugin is checked for security before release, and we have an agreement with them for ongoing checks as well. If you are creating a free theme or free plugin, you might not have the resources to add solid checks like that.</p>\n<h3><a class=\"toplink\" href=\"#top\"><i class=\"fa fa-level-up\"></i></a>How to pick the right plugin</h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignright wp-image-729535\" src=\"https://cdn-images.yoast.com/uploads/2014/11/ratings-wordpress-org.png\" alt=\"Ratings on WordPress.org example\" width=\"250\" height=\"216\" srcset=\"https://cdn-images.yoast.com/uploads/2014/11/ratings-wordpress-org.png 452w, https://cdn-images.yoast.com/uploads/2014/11/ratings-wordpress-org-250x216.png 250w, https://cdn-images.yoast.com/uploads/2014/11/ratings-wordpress-org-174x150.png 174w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\">If you want to be taken by the hand in selecting the right WordPress&nbsp;<strong>security</strong> plugin for your website, please read this in-depth article Tony Perez did on the subject:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/09/understanding-the-wordpress-security-plugin-ecosystem.html\" onclick=\"__gaTracker(\'send\', \'event\', \'outbound-article\', \'http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/09/understanding-the-wordpress-security-plugin-ecosystem.html\', \'Understanding the WordPress Security Plugin Ecosystem\');\">Understanding the WordPress Security Plugin Ecosystem</a>.</p>\n<p>Let me focus on the basics of plugin selection&nbsp;here. As explained above, free plugins and themes could be&nbsp;a <strong>possible</strong> vulnerability. When adding a plugin (or theme for that matter), always check the rating of that plugin.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\" onclick=\"__gaTracker(\'send\', \'event\', \'outbound-article\', \'https://wordpress.org/plugins/\', \'WordPress.org\');\">WordPress.org</a>&nbsp;shows ratings, but one five star rating won’t tell you anything, so also check the number or ratings. Depending on the niche, a plugin should be able to get multiple reviews. If more people&nbsp;think a plugin is awesome and take the time to rate it, you could decide to use it too.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright wp-image-729537\" src=\"https://cdn-images.yoast.com/uploads/2014/11/compatibility-wordpress-org.png\" alt=\"WordPress 4.5.2 compatible example\" width=\"250\" height=\"130\" srcset=\"https://cdn-images.yoast.com/uploads/2014/11/compatibility-wordpress-org.png 446w, https://cdn-images.yoast.com/uploads/2014/11/compatibility-wordpress-org-250x130.png 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\">There is one other thing you want to check. If a plugin hasn’t been updated for two years,&nbsp;WordPress will tell you that. That&nbsp;doesn’t mean it’s a bad plugin, it could also mean there hasn’t been a need to update it, simply because the plugin still works. The ratings will tell you that, and the compatibility with the current&nbsp;WordPress version, which is also listed on the plugin page at wordpress.org. Having said that, Sucuri strongly recommends against using any plugins that haven’t been updated for that&nbsp;long. You should take their word for it.</p>\n<p>Based on these ratings and compatibility, you could&nbsp;pick your&nbsp;plugins less random and have a larger chance of&nbsp;some kind of security being added.</p>\n<h2 id=\"contactsucuri\"><a class=\"toplink\" href=\"#top\"><i class=\"fa fa-level-up\"></i></a>Contact Sucuri</h2>\n<p>I’ve already mentioned <a href=\"https://sucuri.net/\" onclick=\"__gaTracker(\'send\', \'event\', \'outbound-article\', \'https://sucuri.net/\', \'our friends at Sucuri\');\">our friends at Sucuri</a>.

	(15,'<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have to admit I have never bought into the idea of doing one big annual spring clean. I am more the sort of person that likes to do little bits of cleaning every week. I find doing that makes ‘Spring cleaning’ more manageable and on some <del>very</del> rare occasions even ‘enjoyable’.</span></p>\n<p>I don’t think I have ever been a ‘hoarder’ – if anything, I have been great at downsizing and keeping things (wardrobe and stuff) on the lean side. Main reason for this has been that I’ve moved around too many times in the past fifteen years. I was only eighteen when I moved from my family home and to Stockholm.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During my first three months in Stockholm, I bought two guitars, one keyboard and a few percussions that I had to move with me when I ran into renting issues. I was working in the music industry and using all my spare time playing music and dreaming about&nbsp;one day becoming a songwriter. Renting was new to me and the issues came out of nowhere bursting my little bubble. I don’t think I had appreciated the security that comes with living in one place before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would still not admit to being a hoarder today but having just been in my loft I think I might be in denial. I have not one but three pushchairs stored up there. I only have one toddler so I really don’t need the extra pushchairs but I find it very difficult to get rid of them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under my bed, there are bags of new baby clothes and reusable nappies (that we’ve still not used). I am that age when family and friends are having babies so I think I might be keeping this stuff for them. On the other hand, I do want to have another baby one day and although that is looking very unlikely at the moment the thought is kind of comforting to me. Being mum rocks! </span></p>\n<p>I am not going to talk about all the pre-pregnancy clothes I am still keeping for when I finally get back into shape. I know I will get there. I just need&nbsp;to follow a plan for longer than one day and hopefully, I will get back into my skinny jeans again.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All this denial and reasons aside, I know there are things I am looking to improve to enhance my living space. So I guess in a way I am having a spring clean. You still won’t catch me cleaning windows but definitely looking for better storage solutions that will increase the&nbsp;functionality of the space I have without compromising too much on my empty space. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.warehousestoragesolutions.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warehouse storage solutions</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> approached me around the same time and asked if I would be interested in sharing thoughts on cost-effective storage solutions.

At first, I thought this was the&nbsp;law of attraction at play and they were offering to demonstrate their know-how and solve my storage needs.As part of their services, they offer a full diagnostic check on your&nbsp;current use of storage before providing bespoke solutions to their clients. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That got me thinking about using a similar approach at home. A home is really just a big storage. You are storing everything there and somewhere there needs to be a balance between what is kept out of sight and not. In modern homes and lives, the amount of ‘stuff’ is overwhelming. Most people would just like me, have a packed wardrobe and if you have kids, toys in every room. It’s about time I re-look at the whole spring cleaning business from a different perspective and make it part of my process in creating a balanced home. Here are five things I have done &nbsp;or am in the process of doing to get things in order. </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Make a checklist</strong>: First things first! When you write down everything you would like to get done – whether that is sorting out the wardrobe, reorganising the loft, going through everything stored under the bed – a list will help organise things and get a plan in place. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Master the art of chunking</strong>: I love writing long lists and sometimes find that I don’t get things done because the list has become too long and a time-consuming chore in itself. Mastering the art of chunking has been so important for me. Chunking is when you break every task down to manageable bites that are realistic based on what time and resource you have. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Clear the clutter</strong>: Creating space for stuff you want to keep will also mean that you have to get rid of some stuff that you really don’t. Over the gone bank holiday, I started clearing things in the bedroom and sorted everything into charity, selling and keeping bags. I will box the stuff I want to sell so it is easier to store while I go through the remaining rooms. I will take the items I can sell to my local boot sale that takes place every Sunday. It will cost me around £13 to hire a space/table and hopefully make some cash from my unwanted things. This is a quick and cheap way to sell unwanted things without having to store them for long. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Clean and clear the space</strong>: It is amazing how much dirt is built up around things stored under the bed or in the loft. After clearing the clutter, there is a great opportunity to clean areas that normally don’t get touched during the usual week to week cleaning. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Upcycling old furniture</strong>: I would still love to get someone professional to help with this but with a little bit of research I know that there are lots of small things I can do by upcycling old furniture and creating better storage for my house. We cleared James’s nursery first because his room was turning into our storage room. After removing all furniture and reorganising the clutter, we decided to use this space as an office. That way we are creating a dedicated area for everything work related, reorganising and storing everything we need there too. This is still ‘work in progress and I will add a photo as soon as it is finished.&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is all I’ve got so far. </span></p>\n<p>It has been manageable and I am not putting any pressure to have it all finished by any set deadlines. Instead, I am trying to find enjoyment in the process. So, that is why I still don’t think of this as ‘spring cleaning’ but more as managing my storage options.</p>\n<p><strong>What are your thoughts on having one annual big Spring Clean? </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Disclosure:</strong> This is a sponsored post but all views/thoughts and experience shared are my own.&nbsp;</p>','http://workingmumblog.com/solving-your-spring-cleaning-dilemmas/'),

I then get the laptop out most morning/evenings to&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">finish off what I was couldn’t get done in the office and try and squeeze&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some work in for my new business idea too.</span></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><b> What influenced your decision to go back to work?</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We needed to eat lol!!

I’ve done it 3 times now and it doesn’t get any easier&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to leave your new baby with strangers. I’ve often found myself driving to&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the office in tears after leaving a screaming child at nursery.

Ultimately I would love to spend more time at home and be there more&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for my children. The company I work for is really good and very&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">understanding about the usual family life requirements but ultimately I get&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more done when I’m in the office.

	(17,'<p>Imagine being in constant stabbing pain. Not being able to do the simplest things, like getting dressed, cooking a meal or getting a good night’s rest. I was a teenager when my aunt was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in her early 40s and these are some of the things she struggles with daily.</p>\n<p>As a professional hairdresser and makeup artist, she was devastated to hear this diagnosis. Most my memories from her are from being in the hair salon, holding on to a pair of scissors. Even when at home, she was always doing something with her hands, cooking, applying makeup and show us how to do little bits and bobs in the garden.</p>\n<p>Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory joints disorder. It affects different people in different ways but generally causes joint pain and swelling and some stiffness making some of the most basic things very difficult and painful.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I was pregnant, I experienced something known as carpal tunnel syndrome. It is a common symptom experienced by those with arthritis too. From what I know, the pain and discomfort I experienced is nothing compared to the constant pain my aunt experiences every day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is now nearly 15 years since my aunt was diagnosed and over the years she has developed ways to cope. Here are three tips that she has kindly shared with me to include in this post. </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diet matters – tomatoes and pork are two of the foods that trigger more pain for my aunt. She keeps a food journal to make note of any food or drinks that increase or decrease her symptoms. At the beginning, it helps to keep a detailed journal of what you are consuming and then work together with a certified dietitian to draw up a meal plan for you. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exercise helps with improving sleep and alleviating stiffness – moderate walks, Zumba to light yoga are some of the ways my aunt is adding movement into her daily routine. She finds that light exercise not only helps with weight management but also contributes to better quality of sleep. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explore alternative ways to manage pain – my aunt is on medication – without them the pain is too much to function but alongside her medication she is always exploring natural ways to manage her pain – through acupuncture, meditation, and hot/cold therapy. The key is to keep trying new things and be curious about natural ways to manage pain.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you know of anyone that suffers from arthritis? If you have more tips to add, please comment and I’ll update the post with the best ones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is a link to a </span><a href=\"http://adjustablebeds.co.uk/living-and-sleeping-with-arthritis/#.V0HUBhMrLnB\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free ebook</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with more advice, insights and real life stories from people that suffer from arthritis.</span></p>\n<p>Thanks for reading.<br>\nP xx</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This post is in collaboration with </span><a href=\"http://adjustablebeds.co.uk/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adjustable beds</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

I absolutely&nbsp;fell in love with everything! The girls range is stunning and I spent a good part of my visit looking through clothing for girls. I only have my boy and I was even more delighted to discover that the Nutmeg clothing for boys offers variety. That is something I have struggled to find when shopping for new clothes for my toddler.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>J is just over 18 months and dressing him into cute/cool outfits is so much fun. I am looking for practical clothing with that extra thing that I can’t describe in words. The closest word I can think of is personality.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nutmeg offers playful and stylish outfits that hit a cord with what I am looking for when shopping for my J.</p>\n<p>All the three&nbsp;tshirts&nbsp;I bought are priced £3. I like the pockets –&nbsp;J has started to fill his with little bits and bobs he finds when in the garden. Yesterday, he came running into the kitchen with a little dandelion sticking out – what a charmer!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The grey tshirt&nbsp;has a funny little monkey detail instead of a pocket – the monkey mouth can be opened and closed – there is velcro on the inside. It’s a funny little touch!</p>\n<p>The shorts are £5&nbsp;and have adjustable waist&nbsp;which is very handy as J has a tiny waist. This is available in beige and dark blue – I am going back to get the one in beige next. I bought this in blue because beige tends to look dirty very fast in my house but as mentioned, I will get them in beige as they are really cute (and easy to put on when the&nbsp;weather gets lovely as it is at the moment).&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1898\" style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/workingmumblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Nutmeg-boys-collection-s16.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1898\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1898\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/workingmumblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Nutmeg-boys-collection-s16.jpg?resize=480%2C640\" alt=\"Nutmeg clothing for boys\" srcset=\"http://i1.wp.com/workingmumblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Nutmeg-boys-collection-s16.jpg?resize=225%2C300 225w, http://i1.wp.com/workingmumblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Nutmeg-boys-collection-s16.jpg?w=480 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nutmeg clothing: J is wearing adjustable dark blue shorts £5, t-shirt with pocket (small dinosaur detail on the pocket) £3 and jeans fabric sunhat £5 (comes with a shark cap) – shoes are from Clarks (I bought them for £1 at a charity shop)</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here is J dressed up in his Nutmeg outfit while exploring everything at our local library.&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1899\" style=\"width: 1340px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/workingmumblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Nutmeg-Boy-ss-16-hat-.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1899\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1899\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/workingmumblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Nutmeg-Boy-ss-16-hat-.jpg?resize=1330%2C1442\" alt=\"Nutmeg clothing Boy ss 16 hat\" srcset=\"http://i0.wp.com/workingmumblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Nutmeg-Boy-ss-16-hat-.jpg?resize=277%2C300 277w, http://i0.wp.com/workingmumblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Nutmeg-Boy-ss-16-hat-.jpg?resize=768%2C833 768w, http://i0.wp.com/workingmumblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Nutmeg-Boy-ss-16-hat-.jpg?resize=944%2C1024 944w, http://i0.wp.com/workingmumblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Nutmeg-Boy-ss-16-hat-.jpg?resize=600%2C651 600w, http://i0.wp.com/workingmumblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Nutmeg-Boy-ss-16-hat-.jpg?w=1330 1330w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1330px) 100vw, 1330px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\"></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nutmeg clothing: blue hat with white friendly looking sharks, jeans fabric sun hat – both for £5</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I also bought this headwear pack for £5 – J has been using the sun hat the most especially over the weekend when it got really hot.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I really enjoyed this mini haul.

This is a problem encountered by thousands of travelers every year and a question that regularly pops up in my inbox.</p>\n<p>“How can I stay in Europe for more than 90 days?” I’m asked.</p>\n<p>It’s a great question — with a very complicated answer. I always knew it&nbsp;was&nbsp;difficult, but until I started researching how to stay there longer, I never knew just how difficult. But in the process of this research, I&nbsp;came&nbsp;to learn there are a few ways to stay in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/europe-travel-tips/\">Europe</a> longer than 90 days; they just aren’t well known.</p>\n<p>This post will teach you the options for staying in Europe over 90 days. But first a few things:</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that Europe isn’t a monolithic area —&nbsp;there are varying visa rules throughout the continent —&nbsp;but when people talk about the “90-day limit,” they’re talking about restrictions on the Schengen visa, which is the visa policy that governs 26 countries in Europe. It includes all of the European Union&nbsp;—&nbsp;except Ireland and the United Kingdom&nbsp;—&nbsp;as well as a few non-EU countries.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the Schengen visa?</strong><br>\nThe Schengen visa is a 90-day tourist visa for Schengen Area&nbsp;countries, which are:</p>\n<table border=\"1\" width=\"100%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Austria</td>\n<td><a title=\"Belgium Travel Guide\" href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/belgium/\">Belgium</a></td>\n<td>Czech Republic</td>\n<td><a title=\"Denmark Travel Guide\" href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/denmark-travel-tips/\">Denmark</a></td>\n<td>Estonia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Finland</td>\n<td><a title=\"France Travel Guide\" href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/france-travel-tips/\">France</a></td>\n<td><a title=\"Germany Travel Guide\" href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/germany-travel-tips/\">Germany</a></td>\n<td><a title=\"Greece Travel Guide\" href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/greece-travel-tips/\">Greece</a></td>\n<td>Hungary</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/iceland/\">Iceland</a></td>\n<td><a title=\"Italy Travel Guide\" href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/italy-travel-tips/\">Italy</a></td>\n<td>Latvia</td>\n<td>Lithuania</td>\n<td>Liechtenstein</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Luxembourg</td>\n<td>Malta</td>\n<td><a title=\"Netherlands Travel Guide\" href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/the-netherlands-travel-tips/\">Netherlands</a></td>\n<td><a title=\"Norway Travel Guide\" href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/norway-travel-tips/\">Norway</a></td>\n<td>Poland</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a title=\"Portugal Travel Guide\" href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/portugal/\">Portugal</a></td>\n<td>Slovakia</td>\n<td>Slovenia</td>\n<td><a title=\"Spain Travel Guide\" href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/spain-travel-tips/\">Spain</a></td>\n<td><a title=\"Sweden Travel Guide\" href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/sweden-travel-tips/\">Sweden</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a title=\"Switzerland Travel Guide\" href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/switzerland-travel-tips/\">Switzerland</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>These Schengen countries have a border-free visa agreement that lets residents move throughout the Area without needing a passport. Essentially, it’s as if they’re one country, and you can move as freely as you want. (Residents of the UK and Ireland are also allowed limitless entry.) For non-Schengen citizens, you’re allowed entry into the Area for 90 days within any 180-day period. These days don’t need to be consecutive — the total is cumulative. Once day 181 hits, the count resets itself.</p>\n<p>For example, if I come to the Area in January and stay for 60 days and then come back in June for 10 days, that counts as 70 days in 180 days. Only days you are in the zone during the period count.</p>\n<p>Citizens of most countries are allowed to enter the Schengen Area without having to get a visa beforehand. Your passport simply gets stamped upon your arrival and departure from Europe. You’re allowed to enter and leave from any country you want — they don’t have to be the same. I fly in and out of different countries all the time. Your first entry in the 180-day period is when your 90-day counter starts.</p>\n<p>However, not all travelers are allowed such freedom. <a href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/vikram-success-story/\">Citizens from many countries</a> need to apply for a Schengen visa ahead of time. You’ll be required to fill out paperwork beforehand and fly in and out of the country for which your visa is issued. (Even then, <a href=\"http://somedayillbethere.com/2012/04/no-not-everyone-can-travel-a-bubble-burster/\">you still might not be granted a visa</a>. Spoiler alert: citizens from African and Asian countries get screwed.)</p>\n<p>You can find the specific rules regarding your country at the European Commission website or from the country that is your first point of entry.</p>\n<p>So with that being said, how DO you stay in Europe longer?</p>\n<h2>Part 1: Staying in Europe — The Easy Way</h2>\n<p>With so many visa rules, it’s easy to stay in Europe beyond 90 days as a tourist — you just need to mix up the countries you visit. The United Kingdom has its own rules that allow you to stay 180 days. Most non-Schengen countries such as <a href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/ukraine-travel-tips/\">Ukraine</a>, Moldova, Croatia, Ireland, and some Balkan countries allow you to stay for up to 60 or 90 days. So all you need to do is spend 90 days in the Schengen Area, visit the UK, go to the Balkans, hang out in Ukraine, or drink wine in Moldova. If you align your schedule right, you can easily be out of the Schengen Area for 90 days and then head back into the Schengen Area.</p>\n<p>I spent three months in Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, and <a href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/england-travel-tips/\">England</a> as I waited for my clock to reset and then headed back into Germany for <a href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/how-to-survive-oktoberfest/\">Oktoberfest</a>.</p>\n<p>Not all of Europe is part of the Schengen Area, so if you want to travel the continent for a long time without having to go through the visa process, vary your travel by visiting non-Schengen countries and you won’t have to worry about anything. There’s plenty to see elsewhere while you wait to re-enter the Schengen Area.</p>\n<p><em><strong>—-&gt; Need more tips for Europe? <a href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/europe-travel-tips/\">Visit my destination guide and get in-depth information on what to see and do and how to save money</a>.</strong><br>\n</em></p>\n<h3><strong>What happens if I stay longer than 90 days?</strong></h3>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.nomadicmatt.com/stayineurope003.jpg\" alt=\"staying in europe for more than 90 days\"><br>\nBut what if you do want to stay longer in the Schengen Area? Then what? What if the six months you want to be in Europe is all in the Schengen Area? What if you want to live and work in Europe? When most people ask me about staying in Europe, I know they mean staying longer in the Schengen Area. After all, it covers 26 countries, and visiting so many destinations in 90 days can be a little rushed (you would have&nbsp;an average of 3.4 days per country).</p>\n<p>If you want to stay longer to travel, live, learn a language, or fall in love, then the “move around” option suggested above isn’t going to work for you. You need something else. Luckily, there are a few ways to do this —&nbsp;and I can’t stress enough the importance of the word “few.” Staying more than 90 days in the Schengen Area isn’t easy.</p>\n<p>The Schengen law states that you can’t stay in the Area more than 90 days. If you do, you’re subject to a fine and deportation. How that rule is enforced, though, varies greatly from one country to another. If you overstay by a few days or even a week, you’ll probably be OK. If you overstay longer, you might have problems.</p>\n<p>Some countries do not mess around with visitors overstaying.&nbsp;For example, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland, and Scandinavian countries are all <strong>very</strong> strict about entry and exit. If you overstay your tourist visit by longer than a week, there’s a good chance they’ll pull you aside. Two Australians I know were detained leaving Switzerland due to overstaying their visa by two weeks. They were allowed to go with just a warning, but they missed their flights and had to book new flights.</p>\n<p>I know of someone who overstayed by six months and now has an “illegal immigrant” stamp on her passport. In order to enter Europe again, she must apply for a visa at an embassy from now on and be preapproved. A reader sent me an email about a similar experience: “I made the mistake of attempting to leave from the Netherlands after overstaying a Schengen visa and was caught. I overstayed by about a month, and they hand-drew some sort of insignia in my passport to note my overstay. They told me I’d have to contact the IND and find out if I would be able to enter the Schengen states again.”</p>\n<p>Yet if you leave from <a href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/greece-travel-tips/\">Greece</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/france-travel-tips/\">France</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/italy-travel-tips/\">Italy</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/spain-travel-tips/\">Spain</a> — the southern European countries — you won’t have any problems, provided you (a) haven’t stayed over too long and (b) didn’t catch the immigration officer on a bad day. When I left Greece, no one even looked at my passport. One of my friends met a boy in France, fell in love, and decided to not leave. A year later, when she finally did, the French officials didn’t even look twice. Another friend flew into France and didn’t get an entry stamp. Spain is notorious for not caring, and Americans who decide to overstay for months mention that as the easiest country to exit from.</p>\n<p>That being said, I don’t think it’s wise to overstay. No matter where you are, you can get away with a few days. Maybe a week, especially if you’re heading home. But a few weeks? A few months? The risk is too great. I love going to Europe enough where I wouldn’t want to be banned.</p>\n<p>So, tip #1 for getting extra time in the Schengen Area: leave from a southern European country.</p>\n<h3><strong>Can you just extend your Schengen visa/stamp?</strong></h3>\n<p>The Lonely Planet Thorn Tree forums, while a mess of random posts, are good for one thing: stuff like this. I came across one great quote: “This topic has been discussed ad nauseam here on the boards for years. If someone found a way to extend a Schengen, we would have heard of it by now.”</p>\n<p>He’s right. Simply put, you cannot extend your tourist visa or entry stamp. There’s a 90-day limit, and that’s that.</p>\n<h2>Part 2: How to Stay Longer than 90 Days</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.nomadicmatt.com/stayineurope004.jpg\" alt=\"staying in europe for more than 90 days\"><br>\nOK, but I want to stay in the Schengen Area longer — so <em>what’s a tourist to do?</em></p>\n<h3>1. Get a working holiday visa</h3>\n<p>Working holiday visas are easy to get and the best way to extend your stay —&nbsp;even if you don’t want to work. Citizens of Australia, Canada, and New Zealand (and often South Korea and Japan) are eligible for one- to two-year working holiday visas from most of the Schengen countries. Applicants must apply for this visa from a specific country and be younger than 30 (though, in some cases, like for Canadians working in Switzerland, you can be as old as 35).</p>\n<p>Additionally, you can get multiple working holiday visas. Just&nbsp;get a working holiday visa from one country and then move on and get another one from another country. An Australian reader of mine got a two-year Dutch working holiday visa and&nbsp;then&nbsp;got&nbsp;one from Norway to stay two more years. While she and her boyfriend (who also got one)&nbsp;did odd jobs in Holland for a bit, they mostly used it as a way to travel around the continent. <strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;This type of visa won’t allow you to work in any other country than the one that issued it.</p>\n<p>To find out more, visit the embassy of the country you want the visa from in order to apply. Individual countries give these out.</p>\n<p>For Americans, there is no working holiday visa in the Schengen Zone. However, <a href=\"https://www.dfa.ie/travel/visas/us-ireland-visa-arrangements/\">American citizens who are in school or within a year of graduation&nbsp;can get a working holiday visa for Ireland</a>. That will allow you to live and work in Ireland.</p>\n<h3>2. Get a long-term-stay visa</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, the majority of the countries do not allow long-term-stay visas for visitors. In my pursuit of a long-term visa for Sweden, I found that there’s no universal long-term tourist visa for the Schengen Area. Schengen allows for a C- or D-class visa (the letter varies on the country), which is a semi-permanent residence visa for up to one year. But the specific visa and requirements vary from country to country. Some countries are harder, some are easier, and others are nearly impossible despite being in the same visa treaty zone. (I don’t understand the variance either. Same zone, different rules — it makes no sense. You’d think if they were to all have the same rules they would abide by the same visa.)</p>\n<p>But there are a few countries that do offer long-term visas, and these countries are the way into Europe:</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/france-travel-tips/\">France</a></strong><br>\n<img src=\"http://media.nomadicmatt.com/europe90days1.jpg\" alt=\"Amazing view of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France in the summer\"><br>\nFrance offers a long-term visitor visa for a period of up to one year. The application process takes up to one month. According to the French Embassy, “The ‘visitor’ visa (or visa ‘D’) allows you to enter France and stay for more than three months. Long-stay visa holders will be allowed to reside in France for up to 12 months according to the validity of their visa and purpose of stay.”</p>\n<p>To get this visa, you must set up an appointment at the French consulate near you. You can’t walk in — you must make an appointment.</p>\n<p>At this appointment, bring the following documents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One application form filled out completely and signed</li>\n<li>One ID picture glued onto the application form</li>\n<li>Your original passport, which must have been issued less than 10 years ago, be valid for three months after your return, and have at least two blank pages left</li>\n<li>A letter certified by a notary public that promises you won’t engage in work</li>\n<li>A letter of employment stating current occupation and earnings</li>\n<li>Proof of income (you’ll need bank statements or copies of your investment portfolio)</li>\n<li>Proof of medical insurance that includes evacuation insurance</li>\n<li>Proof of accommodation in France. (The French consulate never returned my emails, so I was unsure how you could have this before you even get to France. One could use a friend’s address or, lacking that, “rent” a place (one where you can get a refund) for the purposes of the interview. It’s a little fuzzy.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can’t apply for this visa more than three months before your arrival date.</p>\n<p>You can visit the French Embassy website for links to local embassies and consulates for more information.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/sweden-travel-tips/\">Sweden</a></strong><br>\n<img src=\"http://media.nomadicmatt.com/europe90days2.jpg\" alt=\"A river view of the city of Stockholm, Sweden\"><br>\nSweden also offers a long-term stay tourist visa for a maximum period of one year. The process is easy but long — up to eight months! It’s not something to do at the last minute (though if you already in the country, the process only takes a couple of weeks). You’ll need two copies of the following documents when applying for the visa:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Residence permit for visitor’s application form</li>\n<li>Notarized copies of the pages of your passport that show your identity and the validity of your passport, as well as copies of all the other visas/stamps you have</li>\n<li>A bank statement showing your&nbsp;means of&nbsp;supporting yourself for the duration of your stay</li>\n<li>A return airplane ticket</li>\n<li>A letter from your insurance company stating you’re covered overseas</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Applications can be delivered in person during visiting hours (no appointment needed) or mailed to a Swedish consulate.</p>\n<p>After your documents are received, you’ll be required to have an interview with one of the immigration officers. Most people who apply for this visa have family in Sweden. If you don’t, you’ll need to have clear reasons as to why you need to stay longer and show ample proof that you can support yourself (i.e., “I want to meet Swedish guys/girls” won’t cut it!). If you’re applying in Sweden, you’ll need to put a local’s address on your application form, and that person will have to accompany you to your interview!</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/italy-travel-tips/\">Italy</a></strong><br>\n<img src=\"http://media.nomadicmatt.com/europe90days3.jpg\" alt=\"The colorful buildings and skyline of Florence, Italy\"><br>\nLike the other countries, Italy will let you in if you can afford it and promise not to work. You’ll need the following documents to apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A long-term visa application filled in and signed at the consulate. You must appear in person.</li>\n<li>One passport-style photo</li>\n<li>Your passport, which has to be valid three months over the planned stay in Italy. The passport will be kept during the application process.</li>\n<li>Documented and detailed guarantee of steady income, as well as proof of financial means, such as letters from the bank indicating the status of your account, including the amount of money in the account.</li>\n<li>Proof of lodging in Italy</li>\n<li>A letter specifying the reason for your stay in Italy, length of stay, and where you plan to reside</li>\n<li>A notarized background check</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This visa is issued solely to those who are planning to move to Italy and not work.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;Spain and Portugal also offer long-term-stay visas, but they’re geared to people who are retired or plan to work in the country and have a lot of assets. They aren’t meant for people passing through, but you can always try and apply anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional notes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The rules are not universal. In some cases (depending on your country of citizenship), additional documents may be required. You’ll want to check with your local embassy for specifics, but you aren’t restricted from applying for these visas from your home country.</li>\n<li>All of these visas will require you to show proof that you either have income, have a lot of savings, or both. This is about proving you don’t need to work. They’re adamant about not letting these visas be someone’s back-door way of getting into the EU and finding a job. While most didn’t give an exact number, I would say that if you don’t have at least $25,000 USD in your bank account when you apply, you shouldn’t apply. It’s hard to say for sure how much you’re required to have, as the embassy websites aren’t specific. It’s most likely at the discretion of the immigration officer, but the more money you can show, the better. For citizens coming from developing countries, this number might be higher, and you may even need someone to vouch for you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because of Europe’s open-border policies, you simply need to enter and exit from the country that issued you the visa, but you can be anywhere in Europe during the length of your visa. Once a country has issued you one of these short-term-stay residence visas, you’re a “resident,” allowing you access to anywhere in Europe.&nbsp;So you can use one of these countries to get a long-term stay visa, use it as your “home base,” and just travel around.</p>\n<h3>3. Get a “student” visa</h3>\n<p>All Schengen Area countries offer student visas that aren’t hard to obtain so long as you’re enrolled in a recognized university program. This would require you to pay for the course, but it will virtually guarantee you a visa.</p>\n<p>The best country to do this in is Spain (Portugal also offers a student visa that is easier to get than other countries), where a whole industry has sprung up to help “students” study Spanish. There are tons of schools that will allow you to enroll and write letters stating you’re a student there. (You’ll also need to apply in your home country!) <a href=\"http://www.dtravelsround.com/2015/06/09/getting-a-student-visa-for-spain-as-an-american/\">This blog post details the process in great depth</a>.</p>\n<p>One thing to note is that this process is expensive, since you have to pay for the class, visa fees, and required background checks, but if you really want to stay a full year, it might be worth the cost.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Be “self-employed”</strong></h3>\n<p>Germany offers a “self-employment” visa. If you’re a freelancer, artist, or have some form of income, this is the visa to get (and it’s quite easy to get). It’s perfect and will give you one to two years in the EU. This isn’t a business visa where you move your company to Germany, but a visa for contract workers, artists, web folks, and other freelance-type jobs.</p>\n<p>You need to apply for this visa when in Germany.&nbsp;The process usually takes about a week. You simply need the following documents at your visa appointment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A completed application form</li>\n<li>Two passport photos</li>\n<li>Bank statements — like the other visas, they want to know you have money just in case you don’t find work. As before, the more money, the better.</li>\n<li>A copy of your résumé.</li>\n<li>Proof of residency — You’ll either need to be on a rental contract or be on someone’s rental agreement. You need to bring an official copy of the rental agreement to the immigration office. Adam of <a href=\"http://www.travelsofadam.com\">Travels of Adam</a>, says, “All I’ve ever had are short sublets. You still have to register at a local city office, but all I’ve done is show up with a printed-out lease from the Internet and submitted that. Once you do that, you get the official form from the local office and that’s all the visa people want to see.”</li>\n<li>Health insurance — you need to have German insurance that’s valid for at least one year. It’s easy to get once you’re in Germany, and you don’t need to be a German citizen to get it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bring a German speaker with you just in case there’s a need for translation. The process is pretty straightforward. You might get lucky and get the visa that day. Or they might review it over the course of a couple of weeks. But if they do that and your 90-day Schengen visa is close to expiring, they’ll give you a temporary three-month visa extension while they process your request. In theory, one could apply for the visa knowing they won’t meet all the requirements simply to get the three-month temporary visa.</p>\n<p>It’s very rare someone is denied for this visa if they can show they have a job, income, or money in the bank. How they determine an “artist” is a pretty loose.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Czech Republic also has freelancer visa. It’s just as complex to get and you’ll need at least $6,000 USD in your bank account as proof you aren’t going to leech off their services. The lovely folks at Wandertooth, who did this process last year, <a href=\"http://www.wandertooth.com/freelance-visa-europe-work-in-prague-non-eu/\">walk you through the steps</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>5. Get married</strong></h3>\n<p>Fall in love with a European (or at least a friend) and apply for a marriage visa! You’ll get to stay there while the application process goes through.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">********</p>\n<p>The best, easiest, and most effective way to stay in Europe long-term is to increase the number of countries you visit so you’re in the Schengen Area for only 90 days. As I said, there are a lot of countries not in the Area, so this is easy to do.</p>\n<p>If you’re like me and want to stay longer than 90 days, be prepared to work the system.</p>\n<p>If you do want to stay in the Schengen Area beyond the 90-day limit, you need to apply for one of the visas listed above. When you go to the interview, make it crystal clear that you have enough money to support yourself, you’re not looking for a job, and give good reasons why you need to stay longer. “I want to spend more time drinking in Greece” will get you nowhere.</p>\n<p>In the end, it’s not impossible to stay longer in the Schengen Area. By working the system a bit and using the few loopholes that do exist, one can legally stay past 90 days and <a href=\"http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/europe-travel-tips/\">enjoy all Europe has to offer</a> without worrying about being barred for life.</p>\n<p><b>Want more advice?

A fabulous solo&nbsp;trip to Savannah, a wonderful&nbsp;day trip to the North Fork, I wrote what could be my best blog post ever, and I made so many memories with friends.</p>\n<p>Here’s what went down in May!</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-17004\" src=\"http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FullSizeRender_6.jpg\" alt=\"Astor Row, Harlem\" width=\"576\" height=\"454\" srcset=\"http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FullSizeRender_6.jpg 1554w, http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FullSizeRender_6-300x236.jpg 300w, http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FullSizeRender_6-768x605.jpg 768w, http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FullSizeRender_6-1024x807.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\"></p>\n<h3><strong>Destinations Visited</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>New York, Riverhead, Mattituck, Cutchogue, Greenport, and Orient, New York</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Savannah, Georgia</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Favorite Destinations</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Savannah holds my heart, now and forever.</strong> Then again, so does New York.</p>\n<p><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(\'/downloads/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSCF4881.jpg\');\" href=\"http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSCF4881.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-16925\" src=\"http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSCF4881.jpg\" alt=\"Savannah\" width=\"576\" height=\"384\" srcset=\"http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSCF4881.jpg 1024w, http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSCF4881-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DSCF4881-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\"></a></p>\n<h3><strong>Highlights</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Spending three lovely days in Savannah.</strong> I’ve already waxed poetic about much of the trip, but I really mean it — Savannah is a&nbsp;place I hope to return to on a regular basis.</p>\n<p><strong>Doing a day trip to the North Fork of Long Island.</strong> Over Memorial Day weekend, four of my girlfriends and I headed out to the North Fork to check out the wineries, scenery, and food. It was a wonderful day and I’ll be writing about it more in depth in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-17016\" src=\"http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FullSizeRender_1.jpg\" alt=\"Kate and Sarah, Crawfish Festival\" width=\"576\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FullSizeRender_1.jpg 1280w, http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FullSizeRender_1-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FullSizeRender_1-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FullSizeRender_1-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\"></p>\n<p><strong>Harlem happenings.</strong>&nbsp;One of my favorites this month was&nbsp;the annual crawfish festival at At the Wallace, which featured plenty of crawdads, Blue Hawaii cocktails, and a brass band that could have been straight out of New Orleans! I also checked out Astor Row with its signature porches, unlike any other street in New York. And a new bakery opened near me — Hamilton’s Bakery — and it’s probably the best cafe in my&nbsp;neighborhood for working.</p>\n<p><strong>New York discoveries.</strong> Some new favorites this month were the incredible rooftop at 230 Fifth in Flatiron, the kickass cover band at Cafe Wha? in the Village, and taking the East River Ferry from Williamsburg to DUMBO in Brooklyn and getting awesome shots as you pass beneath the three bridges.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-17001\" src=\"http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FullSizeRender_2.jpg\" alt=\"Tess\'s Birthday Group Shot\" width=\"576\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FullSizeRender_2.jpg 1632w, http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FullSizeRender_2-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FullSizeRender_2-768x576.jpg 768w, http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FullSizeRender_2-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\"></p>\n<p><strong>Hosting friends.</strong> I had three guests this month. I’m loving opening my home to friends passing through New York and introducing them to Harlem! (My couch-crashing karma restoration is ever-so-slightly progressing.)</p>\n<p><strong>Discovering the Brooklyn Cat Cafe.</strong>&nbsp;WHAT AN AMAZING PLACE! After cat and dog cafes flourished in Asia, they’re now coming to Europe and the United States! The Brooklyn Cat Cafe is in Cobble Hill, it only costs $5&nbsp;to play with the cats for 45 minutes, you can cuddle all of them except the brand new&nbsp;kittens, and all of the cats are available for adoption.</p>\n<p><strong>Cooking up a storm.</strong>&nbsp;I’m reveling in having a kitchen and have been&nbsp;gaining back the cooking skills that I haven’t used in years. This month, two of the best things I made were Thai recipes from Chrissy Teigen’s <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(\'/outgoing/amzn.to/1TSh0XB\');\" href=\"http://amzn.to/1TSh0XB\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cravings</em></a> cookbook. Pork-stuffed cucumber soup? Hilarious, fun to make, and a revelation. <em>Jok moo</em> (Thai rice porridge with pork)? Perhaps the best thing I have EVER made.</p>\n<p><strong>And I decided to start wearing gold jewelry again.</strong>&nbsp;I know that sounds silly, but I’ve been wearing exclusively silver since high school! These days, many designers are only making their pieces in gold, so I figured I could try it out.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-16998\" src=\"http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FullSizeRender_3.jpg\" alt=\"Manhattan Bridge\" width=\"576\" height=\"363\" srcset=\"http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FullSizeRender_3.jpg 1280w, http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FullSizeRender_3-300x189.jpg 300w, http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FullSizeRender_3-768x484.jpg 768w, http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/FullSizeRender_3-1024x645.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\"></p>\n<h3><strong>Challenges</strong></h3>\n<p>This was a fairly easy month, but I did have one incident when I got locked out of my site.

Guys, you don’t want to know how much I pay for hosting this site.

Both books are collections&nbsp;of short stories told by&nbsp;Yunior, a character that must be based at least in part on Diaz himself.</p>\n<p><em>Drown</em> focuses more on the experience of immigrating from the Dominican Republic to the U.S. and all the difficulties encapsulated within it. If you’re new to Diaz, read <em>Drown</em> first. <em>This Is How You Lose Her</em> is much better and far more colorful with language. Even though both books&nbsp;can technically stand alone, it’s better if you have the background from <em>Drown</em> first.</p>\n<p><strong><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(\'/outgoing/amzn.to/1sQPu0r\');\" href=\"http://amzn.to/1sQPu0r\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Mother Tongue</em></a> by Christine Gilbert.</strong> I’ve long been intrigued about Christine’s journey to become fluent in Mandarin, Arabic, and Spanish while traveling with her husband and young children. (I met Christine and her family in Thailand in 2010, just before the events in this memoir begin.) Her blog is one of the more consistently interesting travel blogs&nbsp;out there. And this book, a memoir of her language learning journey? It’s&nbsp;a great read.</p>\n<p>I especially loved learning about the science behind language learning (especially that people with perfect pitch, like me,&nbsp;have an easier time learning&nbsp;tonal languages!), and&nbsp;Christine integrated&nbsp;the science into the memoir seamlessly. The only thing I didn’t like? She omitted a big incident that is documented on her blog <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(\'/outgoing/almostfearless.com/the-longest-shortcut/\');\" href=\"http://almostfearless.com/the-longest-shortcut/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. I get why it was excluded…I just found it weird that something that significant&nbsp;was completely missing from the memoir. That’s the problem with being a blogger-turned-author — it’s harder to discreetly leave stuff out.</p>\n<p><strong><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(\'/outgoing/amzn.to/25DPdzW\');\" href=\"http://amzn.to/25DPdzW\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Troubling Love</em></a> by Elena Ferrante.</strong>&nbsp;I think Elena Ferrante is the most extraordinary living author today. While The Neapolitan Novels (my favorite reads of last year) are her masterpiece, her other novels show that her talent extends beyond that saga. In <em>Troubling Love</em>, a woman tries to unravel the mystery of her mother’s sudden death.</p>\n<p>Ferrante makes me more uncomfortable than any other author. That’s not a bad thing. She is the only author I’ve ever known who finds the dark truths about being a woman and brings them to the surface. In both this book and <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(\'/outgoing/amzn.to/1TYYCJx\');\" href=\"http://amzn.to/1TYYCJx\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Days of Abandonment</em></a>, I grimaced at the protagonist’s embarrassing behavior yet was terrified because I recognized my own potential to behave the same way. How many authors can evoke a reaction like that?</p>\n<p>I’ve got only one book left, and then I’ll have completed Ferrante’s as-yet-translated-to-English works!</p>\n<p><strong><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(\'/outgoing/amzn.to/1TSfZ1S\');\" href=\"http://amzn.to/1TSfZ1S\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Dear Mr. You</em></a> by Mary-Louise Parker.</strong>&nbsp;Don’t pick this up expecting an&nbsp;ordinary celebrity memoir — Mary-Louise Parker is an accomplished author in her own right. This book is a series of letters to the most important men in her life, from her father, past significant others, and her adopted daughter’s uncle to short-term characters like taxi drivers.</p>\n<p>The book weaves in between prose and poetry, fantasy and reality. I had a hard time following a few of the more avant-garde letters, but this was overall such a rewarding collection. In fact, I was inspire to experiment a bit with my writing, using her style, and that turned into&nbsp;my 10 Love Stories post.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/njy0dFFlpAc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<h3><strong>What I Watched This Month</strong></h3>\n<p>I gave up on <em>Orange Is the New Black</em>‘s third season a few episodes in — but this month, I picked it up again.</p>\n<p>Third seasons are often transitional seasons and a bit disappointing (<em>House of Cards</em>, anyone?) but they have their purpose. I’m glad I gave it a second chance; the second half of the season was much juicier&nbsp;than the first. Season Four starts in a few weeks and it’s going to be <em>crazy</em>.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A5kqIPrATaCc2LqxVWzQGbk\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<h3><strong>What I Listened To This Month</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>“7 Years” by Lukas Graham.</strong> How good is this song?! I would bet $500 now that we’ll see it at least nominated for Song of the Year at the Grammys, if not taking home the prize.</p>\n<p>(Then again, the people at the Grammys&nbsp;never seem to know the difference between Song of the Year and Record of the Year and often give the awards in reverse. Like the year Kings of Leon’s “Use Somebody” won for Record of the Year and Beyonce’s “Single Ladies” won for Song of the Year. It should have been the opposite!</p>\n<p>Anyway, Record of the Year is awarded to the performer, the songwriter, and the producers for the overall product. Song of the Year goes to the songwriter alone. A Song of the Year winner should be&nbsp;the kind of song that is unique and original, yet can be adapted and sung in a million different ways and still sound great. Like “Umbrella” by Rihanna (not a winner) or “Kiss from a Rose” by Seal&nbsp;(1996’s winner)&nbsp;or “Rolling in the Deep” by Adele (2012’s winner).</p>\n<p><em>Can you tell I think about this often?</em>)</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-17013\" src=\"http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_5259.jpg\" alt=\"New York Skyline\" width=\"576\" height=\"384\" srcset=\"http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_5259.jpg 1280w, http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_5259-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_5259-768x512.jpg 768w, http://www.adventurouskate.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_5259-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\"></p>\n<h3><strong>Coming Up in June 2016</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>You know, I actually have no idea what’s going to happen in June.</strong></p>\n<p>At first, I thought about heading to the West Coast for ten days or so, but to be honest,&nbsp;the more I thought about it, I didn’t feel good about it. Yes, even though I could do a trip like that for cheap and see some beloved friends, something gnawed away at my stomach. It didn’t feel like it was the right decision.</p>\n<p>So instead I’m going to stick close to home, enjoy the glory that is summer in New York, and do some short trips to some nearby places. I’ve got my eye on Hudson, New York, and I absolutely have to figure out a way to get to the Hamptons this summer!</p>\n<p>Don’t worry, folks — July, August, September and October will be a lot more varied and entertaining&nbsp;in terms of travel!</p>\n<h3><strong>What are your plans for June?

My preference is always peace, however. And I’ve shown that.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that was a far cry from the tone of his comments later in an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity, where he delivered a concise rebuttal to the GOP establishment he bested in the primary: “Get over it.”</span></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire night was overshadowed by his recent attacks on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, an Indiana native presiding over lawsuits involving Trump University. His remarks have cast a glum mood on Capitol Hill, at least in the Senate, where </span><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/senate-republicans-donald-trump_us_57571e22e4b07823f9518738?l9j4tpc9qhp4g3nmi\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:0}}\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Republicans are scrambling to condemn Trump’s racist comments</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while, somehow, still standing by him as their party’s presidential nominee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sen.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who called Trump’s attacks “</span><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-donald-trump_us_575700fee4b0ca5c7b5038c2?mmlwr099h51urf6r\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:2}}\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,” called on others to do the same. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) suggested</span><a href=\"https://politicalwire.com/2016/06/07/flake-suggests-convention-challenge-to-trump/\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:3}}\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a challenge to Trump</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the GOP convention this summer.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other side of the Capitol, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), who has urged against engaging in the kind of identity politics Trump has mastered, called Trump’s attack on the judge the “</span><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-trump-racist_us_5756d6cbe4b07823f9514086\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:4}}\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">textbook definition</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” of racism. Yet he stopped short of withdrawing his support for Trump, calling presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton the wrong direction for America. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he disagreed with Trump’s tirade, but repeatedly refused to answer whether it was racist when pressed by NBC’s Chuck Todd. That led conservative pundit Bill Kristol to accurately conclude: “Official position of the leadership of the Republican Party: Trump is an inexcusable bigot, and Trump must be our next president.”</span></p></div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component embed-asset\"><iframe id=\"twitter-widget-1\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" class=\"twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered\" style=\"position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; width: 500px; height: 182.171875px; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;\" data-tweet-id=\"740222565990473728\" title=\"Twitter Tweet\"></iframe>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump’s prominent surrogates found themselves similarly tormented by Trump’s comments on Judge Curiel.

In a separate interview on MSNBC, Corker </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SopanDeb/status/740192642462519296\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:7}}\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">declined three times</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to say whether Trump is fit to be president. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, an early endorser of Trump, dismissed the furor over what he called the “judge kerfuffle.” He said Trump is “</span><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-donald-trump-racist_us_5756e112e4b0ca5c7b501254\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:8}}\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not a racist</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">” and claimed all that truly mattered was “winning and losing.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further down the ballot, in yet another sign of the turmoil, an Iowa state senator became the </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/07/david-johnson-iowa-state-senator-leaves-republican-party-trump?CMP=share_btn_tw\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:9}}\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">first elected official to leave the GOP</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> over Trump. He likened Trump’s rhetoric and candidacy to Adolf Hitler, citing his racist remarks and “judicial jihad” as the final straw.</span></p></div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component embed-asset\"><iframe no-mw-resize=\"\" src=\"http://trumpcards.huffingtonpost.com/\" width=\"640\" height=\"550\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\"><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump, in a statement Tuesday afternoon, offered the closest he has come to an apology, saying it was “unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued.” Now, though, it’s time for Republicans to stop being sore losers and get over it, he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Some of the Republicans — and in all fairness they’re some of the people I went through war with, and I won, and there’s a lot of — there’s a lot of anxiety there,” he said. “There’s a lot of anger, I guess, anger they can’t come back. They can’t get over it. So they have to get over it, ideally. As to whether they endorse me? It’s okay if they don’t, but they have to get over it, they shouldn’t be angry for so long.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump was noticeably less combative in his speech Tuesday night. He called himself a unifier, brandished his record of protecting American workers from bad trade deals, dubbed Clinton “an extension of the Obama disaster” and welcomed disillusioned Bernie Sanders supporters into his camp. He also said to buckle up for Monday, when he plans to give “a major speech” about the Clintons. “I think you’re going to find it very informative, and very, very interesting,” he said.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, he found a way to stray from his prepared remarks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No TPP!” shouted an audience member at one point, referring to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“No PPP, you’re right about that,” Trump responded to cheers, apparently unaware that it’s TPP. He added, for some reason, “And you mean, no PP.” He then seemed to realize his mistake and spelled out the name of the trade deal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later Tuesday evening, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus praised Trump’s speech. “Exactly the right approach and perfectly delivered,” he </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Reince/status/740365823236268032\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:10}}\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tweeted</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It remains to be seen whether Trump can pull off a major transformation of his persona to quell the revolt in his party. The general election season is only weeks old, and Trump still has time to unify the party, properly staff his campaign, and build a modern get-out-the-vote effort that can adequately compete with Democrats. He has time. But since he became the presumptive GOP nominee, he has shown neither the inclination nor the ability to be anything but what he is: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a guy who turns 70 in a week who’s not used to being anyone other than himself.</span></span></p>\n<p><em>Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly </em><a

Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) became the first Republican member of Congress to rescind an endorsement of Donald Trump, saying on Tuesday that he could no longer support his party’s presumptive nominee for president after Trump’s racist attacks against a federal judge.</p>\n\n\n<p>“I cannot and will not support my party’s nominee for President,” he said.</p>\n<p>Kirk’s statement was the most powerful denunciation of Trump to come from Republicans on Capitol Hill, but it was hardly the only one, suggesting that Trump’s racist attacks are finally starting to worry GOP lawmakers.</p>\n<p>Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), one of the few Republican senators who have not backed Trump, went a step further,&nbsp;arguing that Trump’s comments could motivate Republicans to challenge him at the party’s convention in July.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>“Where there’s no talk of a convention challenge or anything else, this might spur it,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill.&nbsp;“Let’s face it: meet the old Trump, just like the new Trump. We’ve got what we’ve got. That’s not somebody who can win the White House.”</p>\n<p>Flake’s remarks came just a day after affirming that he still <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-flake-donald-trump_us_5755f15ce4b0ca5c7b4fd8fc?utm_hp_ref=politics\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:0}}\">cannot support</a>&nbsp;Trump. He said that Trump accusing U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel of bias because of his “Mexican heritage” marked “a whole new level” for the presumptive GOP nominee. Flake also slammed Trump for not having serious policy proposals.</p>\n<p>“‘We’re going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it’ is not a serious proposal,” Flake said. “They want serious proposals on how to deal with this war on terrorism. Saying that you’re going to ban Muslims from entering the country is not a serious proposal.”</p>\n<p>Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), another senator who has yet to back Trump, told a local radio station <span class=\"aBn\" tabindex=\"0\" data-term=\"goog_508792904\"><span class=\"aQJ\">on Tuesday</span></span> that Trump’s comments <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/susan-collins-trum?utm_term=.fvBwr1916#.ckAzngZg7\" target=\"_blank\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:1}}\">“make it very difficult for me.</a> It makes the decision a hard one.”</p>\n<p>Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), a Trump supporter, warned that the presumptive nominee has “two or three weeks” to change the course of his campaign, telling Yahoo News that <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-2-3-weeks-fix-000000452.html?soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma\" target=\"_blank\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:2}}\">Trump’s attacks against Curiel were “inappropriate.”</a></p>\n<p>“He’s got this defining period that’s over the next two or three weeks where he could pivot, can pivot, hopefully will pivot to a place where he becomes a true general election candidate,” Corker said.</p>\n<p>Kirk, who faces a tight re-election battle in November against Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), put out <a href=\"http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/sen-mark-kirk-withdraws-support-for-trump/\" target=\"_blank\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:3}}\">a lengthy statement Tuesday condemning Trump</a>.</p>\n<p>“I have spent my life building bridges and tearing down barriers – not building walls. That’s why I find Donald Trump’s belief that an American-born judge of Mexican descent is incapable of fairly presiding over his case is not only dead wrong, it is un-American,” he said.</p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<p>Kirk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/frankthorp/status/740276773712076800/video/1\" target=\"_blank\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:4}}\">told NBC News</a> that the rest of the party should follow his lead.</p>\n<p>“I think we should send a strong message that racism and bigotry are not going to be tolerated in the party of Lincoln,” he said, adding that he plans to write in retired Army general and former CIA director David Petraeus in November.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Kirk’s announcement followed a call from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) earlier on Tuesday <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-donald-trump_us_575700fee4b0ca5c7b5038c2?mmlwr099h51urf6r\"

Tuesday, Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) became the first major Republican figure to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-senators-donald-trump_us_57571fcfe4b0b60682df2e27\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:4}}\">retract his endorsement</a>.

Bob Corker (R-Tenn) has issued something of an ultimatum:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm canvas-atom\" data-type=\"text\" data-reactid=\".25lg9aj9hw0.$tgtm-Col1-0-ContentCanvas.0.4.0:$1\">Donald Trump has two to three weeks to fix his campaign or risk losing enough Republican support that it would doom his run for the presidency, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker told Yahoo News on Tuesday.</p>\n<p class=\"canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm canvas-atom\" data-type=\"text\" data-reactid=\".25lg9aj9hw0.$tgtm-Col1-0-ContentCanvas.0.4.0:$2\">“He’s obviously stepped in it. He’s made statements that are inappropriate,” Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, said in a telephone interview. The senator was referring to Trump’s widely condemned declaration that a Mexican-American judge is unfit to preside over a Trump University lawsuit because of the judge’s heritage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm canvas-atom\" data-type=\"text\" data-reactid=\".25lg9aj9hw0.$tgtm-Col1-0-ContentCanvas.0.4.0:$2\">Corker went on to say that Trump had entered a “defining period” in which he absolutely must “pivot” to becoming an acceptable “general election candidate.” And if you’ve never heard of this defining period before, well, that’s because no major party’s candidate has really ever faffed up the post-primary period quite like Trump has.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm canvas-atom\" data-type=\"text\" data-reactid=\".25lg9aj9hw0.$tgtm-Col1-0-ContentCanvas.0.4.0:$2\">Of course, no major party candidate comported himself with such reckless disregard for societal norms&nbsp;<em>during&nbsp;</em>the primary process either, so it’s hard to see Corker’s three-weeks-to-fix-this-or-GTFO deadline as anything other than late in coming. But as the New Republic’s Jeet Heer theorizes, Trump’s disparagement of Curiel seems to have been, at last, <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/134044/trumps-attack-gonzalo-curiel-final-straw\" target=\"_blank\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:7}}\">the proverbial bridge too far</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What makes the Curiel case so special that Republicans are acting as if Trump has finally crossed the line? The most likely explanation is that Curiel is a member of the governing elite, like Gingrich and Ryan, and in his capacity as a judge is part of the supposedly apolitical ruling class. Joseph McCarthy followed a similar trajectory: He destroyed the lives of countless Americans with his demagogic anti-communism, but only received bipartisan pushback when he went after the Army in 1954.</p>\n<p>As Talking Points Memo editor Josh Marshall <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/740032121608232960\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:8}}\">shrewdly noted</a> on Twitter, Curiel is a specific individual with a biography, whereas the objects of Trump’s other attacks were mainly hypotheticals. Trump was promising to bar Muslims and deport undocumented immigrants, but the very fact that these measures would encompass millions of faceless people makes them hard to think about except in abstract terms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Heer goes on to note that what made Trump’s attacks on people like Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and others more acceptable is that those could always be chalked up to “politics ain’t beanbag.” Those insults came at a time when Trump was, as they say, “in the arena,” competing against his fellow candidates and the GOP establishment writ large to win the primary.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now, <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-2-3-weeks-fix-000000452.html?soc_src=mail&amp;soc_trk=ma\" target=\"_blank\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:9}}\">Corker believes</a>&nbsp;that Trump has basically got to snap to it and get domesticated in a hurry, telling Knox: “He’s got a period of time here that is incredibly important to his campaign to demonstrate that he has the ability to become a general election candidate, to move away from personality issues and move more towards substantive policy issues.”</p>\n<p>The question is, can this be fixed, and who can possibly fix it?</p></div>\n\n<figure class=\"content-list-component image\">\n<img class=\"image__src\" src=\"http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/scalefit_630_noupscale/57573f00160000af04f959bc.jpeg\">\n<div class=\"image__credit js-image-credit\">\nBrian Blanco via Getty Images\n</div>\n</figure>\n\n<div class=\"content-list-component text\"><p>No, no, come on now, let’s leave Jeb alone.</p>\n<p>It would appear that Trump is aware that he is really cocking this up quite badly.

(<a href=\"https://popehat.com/2016/06/01/lawsplainer-is-there-anything-unusual-about-judge-curiels-orders-in-the-trump-university-case/\" target=\"_blank\" data-beacon=\"{&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;mnid&quot;:&quot;entry_text&quot;,&quot;lnid&quot;:&quot;citation&quot;,&quot;mpid&quot;:11}}\">Which he hasn’t, by the way</a>.)</p>\n<p>Basically, Trump is of the opinion that everyone who heard him take numerous shots at Curiel, in which he broadly suggested that his “Mexican heritage” made it impossible for him to justly preside over the ongoing fraud case against Trump University, did not hear him correctly, and he’s really sorry that everyone got it wrong.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is unfortunate that my comments have been misconstrued as a categorical attack against people of Mexican heritage. I am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent. The American justice system relies on fair and impartial judges. All judges should be held to that standard.

But the close marked the first time since July 21,\n  2015, that both the world\'s most prominent oil benchmarks have\n  ended a trading day higher than $50, marking a significant moment\n  for the oil markets, which have been battered for the last two\n  years.\n</p>\n  <p>\n  On Wednesday, both benchmarks are holding comfortably above the\n  $50 mark, suggesting that oil may have settled in a new price\n  bracket. Around 11.10 a.m. BST (6.10 a.m. ET) Brent is up by\n  1.07% to $51.99, while WTI is also higher, having gained 0.95% to\n  trade at $50.84.\n</p>\n  <p>\n  Here\'s how both benchmarks look Wednesday morning:\n</p>\n  <p>\n    <span class=\"KonaFilter image-container display-table image\" data-post-image=\"\">\n      <img src=\"http://static5.uk.businessinsider.com/image/5757ef6e91058422008c751f-1121/screen%20shot%202016-06-08%20at%2011.11.00.png\" alt=\"oil june 8 wti\" data-mce-source=\"Investing.com\">\n      <span class=\"source-only source\">Investing.com</span>\n    </span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    <span class=\"KonaFilter image-container display-table image\" data-post-image=\"\">\n      <img src=\"http://static4.uk.businessinsider.com/image/5757ef6e910584155c8c7575-1116/screen%20shot%202016-06-08%20at%2011.11.18.png\" alt=\"oil june 8 brent\" data-mce-source=\"Investing.com\">\n      <span class=\"source-only source\">Investing.com</span>\n    </span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  After hitting bottom in January when it slipped as low as $28 a\n  barrel, oil has now gained as much as 80%, and there is an\n  increasing feeling within the markets that things are starting to\n  rebalance, which will in turn help to boost prices.\n</p>\n  <p>\n  In mid-May, <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/oil-prices-may-16-2016-5\">Goldman\n  Sachs suddenly turned bullish on oil, saying the market is now\n  rebalancing, and pointing to huge supply disruptions as the\n  crucial reason for doing so.</a>\n</p>\n  <p>\n  Despite oil\'s recent climb, it does seem unlikely that oil will\n  break much higher than $50 in 2016, with a large number of the\n  market\'s most respected oil analysts, including Goldman, backing\n  oil to end the year at around the $50 mark.

Zoo employees and volunteers gathered in the exhibit early this morning, before the Zoo opened, to see gorillas for the first time in ten days. Before reopening the exhibit, the Zoo installed a new, taller public barrier with knotted rope netting and surveillance cameras. In addition to fortifying the gorilla exhibit, the Zoo is redoubling its efforts to support wild gorilla conservation. The Cincinnati Zoo is proud to have supported and partnered with the Mblei Bai Study and related gorilla research efforts in North Congo for the past 15 years. \"This has been a difficult and emotional time for everyone at the Zoo, especially Harambe’s caretakers. We’ve never been through anything like this, and the experience has been surreal,\" said Zoo Director Thane Maynard. \"I see today’s reopening as the symbolic start of a healing process for our staff, our members and the Cincinnati community.\"</a></p>\n<p>A photo posted by Cincinnati Zoo (@cincinnatizoo) on Jun 7, 2016 at 10:15am PDT\n</p></div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thane also says that the eight gorillas in the exhibit <a href=\"http://perezhilton.com/2016-06-01-harambe-cincinatti-zoo-shot-affects-gorillas-depression/?from=post\" target=\"_blank\">are \"doing fine\"</a> after everything that happened.</p>\n<p class=\"no-ant\">[<em>Image via Cincinnati Zoo/<span id=\"phcredits\"><a href=\"http://instagram.com\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></span>.</em>]\n</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 9px;\">Tags: <a href=\"http://perezhilton.com/tag/animal_rights/\" title=\"Browse for animal rights\" rel=\"tag\">animal rights</a>, <a href=\"http://perezhilton.com/tag/cincinnati_zoo/\" title=\"Browse for cincinnati zoo\" rel=\"tag\">cincinnati zoo</a>, <a href=\"http://perezhilton.com/tag/controversy/\" title=\"Browse for controversy\" rel=\"tag\">controversy</a>, <a href=\"http://perezhilton.com/tag/harambe/\" title=\"Browse for harambe\" rel=\"tag\">harambe</a>, <a href=\"http://perezhilton.com/tag/harambe_the_gorilla/\" title=\"Browse for harambe the gorilla\" rel=\"tag\">harambe the gorilla</a>, <a href=\"http://perezhilton.com/tag/instagram/\" title=\"Browse for instagram\" rel=\"tag\">instagram</a>, <a href=\"http://perezhilton.com/tag/thane_maynard/\" title=\"Browse for thane maynard\" rel=\"tag\">thane maynard</a>, <a href=\"http://perezhilton.com/tag/viral%3A_animals/\" title=\"Browse for viral: animals\" rel=\"tag\">viral: animals</a>, <a href=\"http://perezhilton.com/tag/viral%3A_kids/\" title=\"Browse for viral: kids\" rel=\"tag\">viral: kids</a>, <a href=\"http://perezhilton.com/tag/viral%3A_news/\" title=\"Browse for viral: news\" rel=\"tag\">viral: news</a>, <a href=\"http://perezhilton.com/tag/zoo/\" title=\"Browse for zoo\" rel=\"tag\">zoo</a></p><p></p>                    ','http://perezhilton.com/2016-06-07-cincinnati-zoo-reopen-exhibit-harambe-the-gorilla-shot-killed-child-fall-enclosure#.V1fYX6OyNBc'),

The company says the internal use of Box’s services will help it develop new enterprise software, including customer-relationship and enterprise-content management solutions, that it plans to release by March 2017 and market throughout Asia.</p>\n<p>Fujitsu will also integrate Box into <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.fujitsu.com/global/solutions/cloud/metaarc/\">MetaArc</a>, its new cloud platform, next year. MetaArc includes third-party services (like Box storage), as well as infrastructure and application hosting services. Customer data uploaded to Box will be stored at Fujitsu data centers in Japan. This will help Box appeal to businesses that don’t want to store their data overseas and complements the company’s new plan to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/04/12/box-europe-asia-cloud-storage/\">offer cloud data centers</a>, called Box Zones, in Ireland, Germany, Singapore, and Japan.</p><div><div id=\"adsDivf7bcf8e732\"

in Europe and Asia is a priority for the company</a>, which <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/23/box-skyrockets-50-to-more-than-21-per-share-in-first-minutes-as-a-public-company/\">went public

At <span class=\"il\">the</span> event<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://blogs.forrester.com/carlton_doty/16-05-04-have_what_it_takes_to_win_in_a_post_digital_world\">, analyst Carl Doty defined <span class=\"il\">the</span> <span class=\"il\">post</span>–<span class=\"il\">digital</span> <span class=\"il\">world</span> as one in which <span class=\"il\">digital</span> is embedded in our daily lives</a>.</p>\n<p>In that context, he described <span class=\"il\">the</span> evolution of marketing: pre-<span class=\"il\">digital</span> marketing meant using&nbsp;mass media in a one-to-many approach; <span class=\"il\">digital&nbsp;</span>marketing was about data-driven, one-to-one personalization; and <span class=\"il\">post</span>–<span class=\"il\">digital</span> marketing means one-to-moment marketing.</p>\n<p>One-to-moment marketing has been on <span class=\"il\">the</span> agenda of major brands and thought leaders for <span class=\"il\">the </span>past few years. Forrester’s Julie Ask opened <span class=\"il\">the</span> conversation about one-to-moment marketing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.mobilemarketer.com/cms/news/strategy/17426.html\">in 2014</a> when she urged brands to think of mobile marketing as an opportunity to create content that matters to consumers based on <span class=\"il\">the</span> context of their moment. <span class=\"il\">Google</span> then rolled out a large body of research around <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/collections/micromoments.html\">micro-moments</a>, or times when consumers use their mobile devices to decide on things to buy, things to do and places to go.<u></u><u></u></p>\n<p>Since 2015, <span class=\"il\">Google</span> has been updating its research with examples of brands that understand how to create contextual content, such as mobile wallet offers that make themselves relevant during those crucial moments of decision making. As <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://time.com/4147614/smartphone-usage-us-2015/\">Deloitte reported</a>, Americans check their smartphones collectively 8 billion times a day. <span class=\"il\">The</span> key for brands is to be present during those moments with content that helps them figure out where to go and what to do instead of serving up intrusive ads.&nbsp;<u></u></p>\n<p>According to Doty, “Marketers must win in customers’ moments. These moments are your opportunity to deliver your brand promise no matter when or where that customer is.” In his view, one-to-moment marketing means anticipating what a customer wants and being present with <span class=\"il\">the </span>right information — for instance, a motorcycle dealer such as Harley-Davidson being present with useful location information when a customer searches for “dealer near me” or “compare bike models.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"il\">The</span> big four — Amazon, Apple, Facebook and <span class=\"il\">Google</span> — intend to embed themselves in every moment. Here are some examples of how they’re doing it.</p>\n<p><b><span class=\"il\">Google</span> Now</b><u></u><u></u></p>\n<p>In 2012, <span class=\"il\">Google</span> took a big step to own micro-moments by launching <span class=\"il\">Google</span> Now. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/product/google-now\"><span class=\"il\">Google</span> Now</a> is significant because it anticipates our search behavior and proactively offers suggestions on what to do, where to go and what to buy (based on what <span class=\"il\">Google</span> knows about our search habits).</p>\n<div class=\"writerquote-wrap right pullquote-right\"><blockquote class=\"writerquote\">Google does not intend to give up ground to anyone.</blockquote></div>\n<p>With&nbsp;<span class=\"il\">Google</span> Now, <span class=\"il\">Google</span> has become a more helpful utility for both consumers (by assisting in their decision making) and brands (by serving up information about them, such as suggestions for where to buy coffee based on <span class=\"il\">the</span> data that brands share with <span class=\"il\">Google</span>). <span class=\"il\">Google</span> Now made it even more important for businesses to share their location data with <span class=\"il\">Google</span> in order to be found.<u></u><u></u></p>\n<p><b>Apple iOS 9</b><u></u><u></u></p>\n<p>In 2015, Apple upped <span class=\"il\">the</span> stakes for predictive search with <span class=\"il\">the</span> launch of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/product/ios-9\">iOS 9</a>. With iOS 9, a simple swipe of your home screen results in Apple Spotlight search offering moment-based suggestions that change depending on <span class=\"il\">the</span> time of day. Apple suggests results for coffee near me in <span class=\"il\">the </span>morning, lunch near me in <span class=\"il\">the</span> afternoon and dinner near me in <span class=\"il\">the</span> evening. iOS 9 has increased Apple’s importance as a critical data publisher for brands.<u></u><u></u></p>\n<p><b>Amazon Dash and Echo</b><u></u><u></u></p>\n<p>Amazon was embedding itself as a utility in its own day in 2015.

At <span class=\"il\">the</span> F8&nbsp;conference, Mark Zuckerberg positioned bots as an easy way for consumers to order what they want from brands instantly via Messenger (sort of like having Dash buttons embedded in Facebook).</p>\n<p>He demonstrated a bot that makes it possible for you to order flowers without talking to a person. “You never have to call 1-800-Flowers again,” he said. With bots, Facebook wants to make <span class=\"il\">the</span> <span class=\"il\">world</span>‘s largest social network <span class=\"il\">the</span> platform for micro-moments to happen.<u></u><u></u></p>\n<p><b><span class=\"il\">Google</span> ups <span class=\"il\">the</span> ante</b><u></u><u></u></p>\n<p>But <span class=\"il\">Google</span> does not intend to give up ground to anyone.

However, several Silicon Valley CEOs and investors poured early financing into one particular candidate – Hillary Clinton.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Chris Sacca, an early investor in Twitter, Uber and Instagram, also bet early on Clinton, contributing to her campaign in July 2006. Bill Gates and Sheryl Sandberg both contributed to Clinton in 2007 before becoming major donors to President Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign. And Carl Icahn, the investor who has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/carl-icahn-donald-trump-business-rivalry-partnership/2016/04/30/4cc69316-024a-11e6-9d36-33d198ea26c5_story.html\"><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">endorsed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, was previously a Clinton&nbsp;fan, having contributed to her senatorial campaign in 2004.</span></p>\n<p>Billionaire investors have a habit of playing both sides and plenty donated to Obama’s 2008 campaign as well as Clinton’s. But Silicon Valley seems to have cooled on Clinton since her last presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>Clinton has yet to net donations from many CEOs and investors in the Valley, even a few who backed her 2008 campaign, according to a TechCrunch analysis of political donations from more than two-dozen well-known investors and entrepreneurs.</p>\n<p>Sacca, who donated $100,000 to Clinton’s campaign in March 2016, is a notable exception, as is Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who began contributing to Clinton’s campaign in May 2015 after initially backing Marco Rubio. But other donors to her 2008 campaign, such as Gates and Vinod Khosla, have yet to reopen their checkbooks.</p>\n<p>It’s possible that Clinton is suffering from the compression that’s hitting the tech industry. The funding market is frothy and investors aren’t giving as freely to startups as they were a few years ago. It’s also possible that Clinton isn’t wowing Silicon Valley as much as she did in the run-up to the 2008 election.</p>\n<div class=\"pullquote-wrap center\"><blockquote class=\"pullquote\">I am looking for a free market candidate who also wants an efficient e-government. … Maybe one who recognizes that the Blockchain is the perfect bureaucrat.</blockquote><span class=\"pullquote-author-pos\">— Tim Draper, investor</span></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Even though Clinton hasn’t received many donations from tech investors early in the race, money is starting to trickle in. In addition to donations from Musk, Sacca and Sandberg, Clinton’s campaign recently received $298,000 from Sean Parker, the Napster founder who has also backed the Marco Rubio and Rand Paul presidential campaigns. (The Federal Election Commission can lag up to 30 days in its publication of campaign finance data, so contributions made in the last month may not be reflected here.)</p>\n<p>Clinton has also rallied support from the tech industry at several recent fundraisers.</p>\n<p>In February, Joyus CEO Sukhinder Singh Cassidy hosted a fundraiser for Clinton at her home, asking for donations between $500 and $2,700. Shervin Pishevar, a venture capitalist and early Uber investor, hosted a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/hillary-clinton-george-clooney-fundraiser-221207\">dinner for Clinton</a>&nbsp;at his San Francisco home in April at which guests could pay $353,400 to sit at a table with Clinton, George Clooney and his wife, Amal Clooney. (Clooney later called the fundraiser’s price tag “<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/clooney-on-clinton-fundraiser-it-s-an-obscene-amount-of-money-667616323817\">obscene</a>” during an NBC interview.)</p>\n<h2>The people’s Bern</h2>\n<p>Venture capitalists haven’t given the same warm welcome to Clinton’s opponent in the primary. At the top tiers of tech, Bernie Sanders seems as untouchable as Trump — none of the donors reviewed by TechCrunch gave to the Sanders or Trump campaigns.</p>\n<p>Sanders may not have appealed to VCs, but he continued to rack up small dollar donations from workers. According to an analysis conducted by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crowdpac.com/\">Crowdpac</a> and confirmed by TechCrunch, Sanders received contributions from 5,319 supporters in Silicon Valley zipcodes, compared to Clinton’s 766 donors and Trump’s measly seven donors.</p>\n<p>The Bay Area is filled with idealistic, young progressives who support Sanders’s messages of reform on campaign finance, banking and housing.

	(44,'<p>Starting down the path to divorce is almost never easy. In addition to the emotional turmoil, there are the practical concerns, perhaps the most primary of which is where each spouse will live. When children are involved, this concern becomes even more urgent as children can be emotionally invested in the family home or there is a need to make the children feel less impacted by the transition resulting from an anticipated separation. One solution to this dilemma that’s been in the news over the past few months is “nesting.” Famous couples including Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck, and Drew Barrymore and Will Kopelman, have reportedly chosen this option, in which separated couples still share a mortgage and/or a living space. But before any couple chooses to nest post-separation, there are issues to consider.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, when we hear the term “nesting,” cozy images come to mind of creating a home. In the context of marriage, nesting was used to refer to readying the home for a baby. In 2016, however, there’s an additional meaning – although it’s still centered on children. Instead of the children traveling back and forth between parental households, the children stay put. In some instances, both parents remain in the home or on the property and in some, a separate household is established (often a rental property, with both parents remaining on the mortgage/deed to the family home), where each parent stays on an alternating schedule.</p>\n\n<p>For some families, nesting is the right option. When couples first separate, they have all sorts of questions regarding parenting plans, often with input from therapists. Nesting can be seen as giving children some breathing room, time to get used to the concept of their parents no longer being a couple, while still having close contact with both. Some therapists recommend that the younger the child, the more frequent contact should be. Nesting is often used as an interim step, between three to six months, usually closer to three, but largely depends on the comfort level of the parents sharing a home and whether the parents are able to keep the children at the forefront (removing them from the adult conversations related to divorce).</p>\n\n<p>Cost can also be an influence on the decision to nest, particularly in areas with high real estate and rental prices such as major cities. Separating couples may find that the cost of keeping the family home plus another household is prohibitive. In these cases, if the separation is amicable enough or the property large enough (for example including a guest house or a mother-in- law suite), they may be tempted to stay put. However, anyone considering this option should look into the divorce laws in their state to determine the impact on their divorce timeline – for example, in North Carolina where my firm is based, couples must verify under oath that they have lived separate and apart for a full year in order to file for divorce. Separate and apart does not mean separate rooms or separate beds.</p>\n\n<p>No matter what you decide regarding nesting, it’s vital to keep precedence in mind. How you set up your future family structure – what you decide will work best for you and your children – must be thought through carefully from the very beginning. Once you’ve agreed to a financial and custody arrangement, once you’ve shown that you can handle the support, the schedule (particularly the schedule that follows the nesting), it may be tough to go back to the court later saying that this arrangement is not manageable or that the support is insufficient. Education is key in order to make decisions of this magnitude. It is paramount that you understand the impact and the potential consequences, because precedence can change your future and your children’s future.</p>\n\n<p>So whether nesting is right for you or whether you think it’s for the birds, when you’ve made the decision to separate, take a deep breath, a step back, and get educated on all the options for the next step on your family’s path.</p>','http://www.workingmother.com/nesting-does-it-count-in-court-and-is-it-right-for-you'),

Three kids later, I know that was just a pipe dream. Side note: sleep is always elusive when you’re a parent, no matter what age your children are.</p>\n\n<p>I made sure both my parents had keys to our apartments and let my in-laws know they had an open invitation whenever they wanted to drop in. No calls necessary. After the twins came, I didn’t hesitate inviting people over and if people asked if I needed help, I was always honest. Heck yeah, I have newborn twins and I’m freaked out.</p>\n\n<p>Having my mother and mother-in-law extremely close-by was the greatest gift of all.

I suddenly thought how nice it’d be if we lived in one of those large communal family homes.</p>\n\n<p>I know my parents love spending time with my children. They feel it’s therapeutic, even if it’s totally chaotic and messy.  So I definitely don’t feel guilty when my parents offer to help out. They come with such love; it’s hard to turn down.</p>\n\n<p>When it came time for my daughter, I knew what to expect and didn’t hesitate to book our night nurse again.

And while I wasn’t in any rush to have kids, I definitely felt my biological clock ticking away as I entered my 30s. Well fast-forward to a few years later, and I’ve had three kids in two years, including a set of twins. Man, did that throw me for a loop. Imagine going from zero to 100 with nothing in between.</p>\n\n<p>Besides becoming a mom, I also always thought I’d stay at home with my kids. I’d be  happy driving carpools, attending PTA meetings, and cooking large family dinners.</p>\n\n<p>But now I realize working is what keeps me sane and true to myself. I totally understand the pull to stay at home versus going back to work. The first few weeks I was alone at home with my twins were great. Overwhelming, but great. It was a steep learning curve but I pushed myself hard and realized I could care for two little  helpless babies and come out smiling. And they did, too.</p>\n\n<p>But as time wore on, I felt my brain turning to mush. At night when I was in bed, I couldn’t get the theme songs to Sesame Street and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse out of my  head. I needed adult interaction. Immediately. I didn’t want to be that mom that used words like yucky, stinky, and booger in polite company like that was OK.</p>\n\n<p>When I called my boss to say I wanted to return, she said she always knew I’d be back. She never had any doubt. I slowly went back to work part-time when my boys were 3-months old and it was the best decision I ever made. Suddenly, my brain  was thinking again, creating again, and working like an adult again. For the first time since giving birth, I felt like my old self again and it felt good.</p>\n\n<p>Now that’s not saying going back to work didn’t come with some pitfalls. I hated being away from the boys. Was I missing their first steps, their first words, or any  other monumental firsts? I felt it took longer to bond with one of my twins. He seemed to gravitate to anyone but me, including my mom, our nanny, and my husband. I had to work hard to gain his affection. Maybe if I had stayed at home that  wouldn’t have been an issue.</p>\n\n<p>But working made me a better mom. I felt more focused, more on top of things, and definitely had more energy. And while that seems counterintuitive, I just felt sharper in all things once I went back to work.</p>\n\n<p>This blog is about family, fun, and finding myself in that maze we call parenting. It’s not always easy, but it’s been more rewarding than I ever could have imagined.</p>\n\n<p>From navigating the terrible twos to figuring out how to make mom friends, welcome to my not-always- pretty but somewhat informative journey. Hopefully, we can all learn something along the way!</p>','http://www.workingmother.com/how-working-made-me-better-mom'),

	(48,'<p>Well, we finally did it.  My husband I took our one year olds to Yellowstone 8 years ago and we all loved it and wanted to come back soon.  It took 8 years to make it happen, but we finally got our Yellowstone vacation. We made the reservations a year before our trip so the children were excited for a really long time and I was worried they would be disappointed. Luckily, we weren&#8217;t.  They liked pretty much everything and want to go back soon.  Whenever we ask them what their favorite part was, they all say &#8220;EVERYTHING!&#8221;</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to go back during the peak season.  It was way too crowded for me and I was NOT impressed by the food options.  They are definitely not Paleo or fresh.  I was really glad we brought along a bunch of our own food so we didn&#8217;t have to rely on them for healthy food options. I discovered that my children have become food snobs, which I am proud of. They do not like processed, &#8220;fake&#8221; food for the most part anymore. We were all missing good home cooked meals.  We stayed in the Canyons area for the first two nights and below are some of my favorite pictures from that area.

	(49,'<p>Just a week or two ago I dropped everything going on and took a trip to California! It was fantabulous! I brought my four children and three of my employees, my mother, sister, and my nanny. My husband stayed home to take care of the house as we are at the end of our renovation and he wanted to be there and make sure things were done correctly. {Side note, our house is looking wonderful and I will put a post about it with completed pictures and everything soon!}</p>\n<p>So let me tell you why we spontaneously decided to go on this trip. As I just mentioned we are renovating our home and in the final stages. So the week we went on vacation was when they were painting, installing everything, among other things. AKA a disaster to have four children around. So the Friday before we went I was talking to my employees about getting a hotel for the week to avoid the construction. So then my sister jokingly suggested going to Disneyland if I was already spending money on a hotel. So we spent that day trying to get the cost down and figure out if the trip was plausible. After hours of playing with numbers and revising our plan over and over we had a good plan. We waited a day to make sure we weren&#8217;t doing something crazy and by Saturday night we had everything reserved and planned out.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34377\" style=\"width: 445px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-34377\" src=\"http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1849-577x1024.jpg\" alt=\"25 Tips &amp; Tricks from Our Disneyland Trip\" width=\"445\" height=\"790\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">My four children on the beach!</figcaption></figure>\n<h1>Our California/Disneyland Trip</h1>\n<h3>Day 1 (Monday): Traveling</h3>\n<p>We left our home in Utah just after 9 am to make the drive to Anaheim, CA in one day. This is a big deal with four children. We made sure we had everything and started on our way.  The trip went pretty smoothly, the kids were able to be entertained and didn&#8217;t have a hard time. We only stopped a couple of times and had one car sickness accident at the gas station. so we had nice people help us clean it up. We ate at Cafe Rio for lunch (one of our favorites) and Olive Garden for dinner. We arrived around 9 pm CA time.  The kids went to sleep well in anticipation for the next day!</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">TIP 1: </span></h2>\n<p>If you are traveling make sure to have things to entertain the children. We watched a lot of Disney movies in the car and time went by fairly fast doing this.</p>\n<div class=\'code-block code-block-1\' style=\'clear:both; text-align:center;\'><div class=\"adthrive-ad\" id=\"MyNaturalFamily_Sidebar_1_ATF_300x250\">\r\n</div></div>\n<h3>Day 2-5: Disneyland Days</h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-34364\" src=\"http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1824-577x1024.jpg\" alt=\"25 Tips &amp; Tricks from Our Disneyland Trip\" width=\"328\" height=\"582\" /></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">TIP 2: </span></h2>\n<p>Before entering the park you have go through security but you only have to once. So have all your bags unzipped and ready to go to make the flow of traffic faster. They check strollers and bags.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">TIP 3</span>:</h2>\n<p>If you bring a stroller it can be a great way to store things and not have to carry them around all the time. The strollers are however not with you when you are in lines or on rides so don&#8217;t put anything valuable in there.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">TIP 4</span>:</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of strollers everywhere so find a way to make yours stand out. You could use a bright colored item attached, a balloon, or some other identifier to make it easier to find yours after an attraction.</p>\n<p>We had 4 adults and 4 children between the ages 4 and 10. This made it very doable to manage the children and have all kinds of fun. We were blessed to have this situation while we were there. We had times when we were together doing rides and such but then later we split up into to groups so that the two older ones could go on the bigger rides and the little ones could still have fun.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">TIP 5: </span></h2>\n<p>If you are planning on splitting up at all make sure the adults have tickets for everyone in that group so you can park hop and get fast passes without problems. We might have learned this the hard way&#8230;:)</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">TIP 6: </span></h2>\n<p>When you have children with you that are really young including babies and toddlers. Take advantage of Rider Swap Pass. This is where you can wait in line and some people can go on the ride while someone stays with the little ones but then you get to swap with a pass and not have to wait in the whole line again. It is wonderful when little ones are there.</p>\n<div class=\'code-block code-block-3\' style=\'text-align:center;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px;\'><div class=\"adthrive-ad\" id=\"MyNaturalFamily_Mid_Post_2_600x250_300x250\">\r\n</div></div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">TIP 7: </span></h2>\n<p>If you have children old enough that they aren&#8217;t too scared to ride by themselves or you are with all adults. The Single Rider line is WAY faster than the normal line. This is especially nice for the popular rides. You still get to wait with your group and come out relatively at the same time. This is highly recommended!</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_34375\" style=\"width: 471px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-34375\" src=\"http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1833-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"25 Tips &amp; Tricks from Our Disneyland Trip\" width=\"471\" height=\"353\" srcset=\"http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1833-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1833-150x113.jpg 150w, http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1833-300x225.jpg 300w, http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1833-600x450.jpg 600w, http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/IMG_1833-90x68.jpg 90w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Waiting outside in the line at Indiana Jones, one of their favorite rides.</figcaption></figure>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">TIP 8: </span></h2>\n<p>Stay in a hotel that is within walking distance of the parks. This makes taking breaks for naps, resting, meals, etc. a lot easier and maximizes the time you can have in the parks! Here is<a href=\"http://www.accommodationsneardisney.com/Disneyland/default.asp\" rel=\"external\" title=\"\" class=\"ext-link\" data-wpel-target=\"_blank\"> a site </a>you can go to view where all the close hotels are in comparison to the entrance and parks.</p>\n<p>We went in January and it was fantastic. It was in the 70s the whole week and the parks were not very crowded. The longest we ever waited for one ride was 30 minutes and that is really good for Disneyland.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">TIP 9:</span></h2>\n<p>Even if you go at a time of the year that has shorter lines, there are still lines. So it can be a good idea to bring something to entertain yourselves while you are in line. Whether that is a book, playing simple games, taking it as a chance to get to know each other better. planning the rest of the day, etc.</p>\n<p>I think the overall favorite ride was at California Adventure, The Cars Ride. It is so awesome!  Some other favorites in both parks were Small World, Teacups, Peter Pan, Indiana Jones, Toy Story and Thunder Mountain Railroad.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">TIP 10:</span></h2>\n<p>We used the app <a href=\"http://ridemax.com/\" rel=\"external\" title=\"\" class=\"ext-link\" data-wpel-target=\"_blank\">RideMax</a> to plan out our days and to get the most in our time at the parks. We mostly used it for the beginning of the day and then just went with the flow later on.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">TIP 11: </span></h2>\n<p>MouseWait is a great <span id=\"IL_AD3\" class=\"IL_AD\">FREE app</span> that has show schedules, parades, restaurants, and attraction wait times. It has quite a few active users in the parks who update it frequently during the day.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">TIP 12: </span></h2>\n<p>Make sure you go if you have children you know the heights of your children and you tell them ahead of time which rides they will not be able to ride. My youngest daughter was 39 3/4 inches tall and one of the main height requirements was 40 inches and some would let her ride and other workers wouldn&#8217;t. We told her we would give it a try but couldn&#8217;t promise anything. It helped prepare and made it less dramatic for her when she couldn&#8217;t go on some of the rides.</p>\n<p>Here is a picture from the Toy Story ride, you sit in a car and it is like a video game where you compete with the person in your cart with you. Megan beat me the first time we did it, I was impressed.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-34353\" src=\"http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/IMG_1825-577x1024.jpg\" alt=\"25 Tips &amp; Tricks from Our Disneyland Trip\" width=\"325\" height=\"576\" /></p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">TIP 13: </span></h2>\n<p>It is always good to make sure your cell phone and cameras are charged, but no worries if they aren&#8217;t. They can drop them off at the Locker Area in Disneyland&#8217;s Main Street and charge your phone for $2 an hour.</p>\n<div class=\'code-block code-block-2\' style=\'text-align:center;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px;\'><div class=\"adthrive-ad\" id=\"MyNaturalFamily_Mid_Post_1_728x90_336x280_300x250\">\r\n</div></div>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">TIP 14: </span></h2>\n<p>If have little ones with you it could be a good idea to make or buy id tags that have the child&#8217;s name and a number to call if they get lost to make it easier to find them. Disneyland is a huge place and one of the worst things to ruin your trip to loose someone!</p>\n<p>Since we were at Disneyland for a total of four days. Eating food was a big deal. We would eat breakfast at our hotel before leaving and then we would have two meals in the parks. There are a lot of restaurants to choose from and it can become very pricy very fast.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">TIP 15: </span></h2>\n<p>It is imperative to plan out where you want to eat for each meal before arriving to the park. It saves a lot of time and hassle. Make reservations ahead of time so that you know you have a spot waiting for you. You can look at all of the menus and such before getting there so you can see if it is somewhere your party would want to eat.</p>\n<p>A lot of the restaurants were similar and about the same thing. Some of them were different and so just take the time to decide what you want to do. They have nicer restaurants and then they also have the stands you can get more quick and fair/park type of food such as a hand battered corn dog.</p>\n<p>There are also many places you can get treats in the parks and they can be great to have in between meals. To help fuel and keep the energy going.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">TIP 16: </span></h2>\n<p>Dairy Free and Vegan Eaters, in the Disneyland park by the Tiki Room you can Pineapple Dole Whip which a fantastic choice. It tastes very good and is great for people who don&#8217;t want to Dairy.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">TIP 17: </span></h2>\n<p>Bring easy snacks with you to keep people satsified in the lines. Some ideas would be granola bars, crackers, pretzels, chips, juice, water, fruit leather, or beef jerky. You don&#8217;t want to bring a ton cause then you will have to carry it around but it can be nice and save some money!</p>\n<p>Random Side Note: I was thinking about it while we were at the park and it would have been so interesting to wear a pedometer while being at the park. So if anyone goes anytime soon, you should count your steps and let me know what the results are so I can fulfill my curiosity.</p>\n<p>We went in January 2015 and there is a special <a href=\"https://disneyland.disney.go.com/events-tours/disney-california-adventure/frozen-fun-celebration/\" rel=\"external\" title=\"\" class=\"ext-link\" data-wpel-target=\"_blank\">Frozen event in California Adventures</a>. There is a show (see picture below), which they play all the music scenes from the movie while you sing along (which I thought was kind of lame but nice for a break). But I liked the end where they sing &#8220;Let It Go&#8221; again and all the characters are on the stage and &#8220;snow&#8221; is falling around you and lights are moving all around you. I thought that part was pretty emotional and fun. You can also meet Elsa and Anna. There was a two hour wait when we were there at the slow time of the year but there is a Fast Pass for it. You can also meet Olaf. There was about an hour wait for that but while we were waiting in line for a Fast Pass, there was no one else there so we got lucky and only had to wait about five minutes. In fact, the Stand-by line for the Frozen show was only about five minutes long too so it is worth a try because not everyone uses their Fast Passes.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">TIP 18: </span></h2>\n<p>Using Fast Passes is a great way to not have to wait in extremely long lines and avoid becoming restless. You have to make sure you use your fast pass in the time frame they give you. So be careful with that!</p>\n<p>The other part of the Frozen Event is in the same building where you meet Olaf. There is an area with fake snow. So, I live in Utah but this is not snow. We had to wait over an hour while they blow &#8220;snow&#8221; on the ground. The &#8220;snow&#8221; is like tiny pieces of ice and the ground is like six inches of compacted, trampled on ice. But &#8211; my children still loved play in it and it was weird but it stayed frozen even though the room wasn&#8217;t very cold. There was also a sledding area that was extremely crowded but looked fun. I thought it was lame but my children loved it so if you have young children,  you may want to check it out. The Frozen Event is there for a limited time only but they don&#8217;t say when it will end.</p>\n<p>The other place we saw Elsa and Anna was at the Parade in Disneyland.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-34467\" src=\"http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-01-13-15.57.35-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"25 Tips &amp; Tricks from Our Disneyland Trip - details about the Frozen Event at Disneyland Winter/Spring 2015\" width=\"581\" height=\"436\" srcset=\"http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-01-13-15.57.35-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-01-13-15.57.35-150x113.jpg 150w, http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-01-13-15.57.35-300x225.jpg 300w, http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-01-13-15.57.35-600x450.jpg 600w, http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-01-13-15.57.35-90x68.jpg 90w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-34468\" src=\"http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-01-13-16.34.37-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"25 Tips &amp; Tricks from Our Disneyland Trip - details about the Frozen Event at Disneyland Winter/Spring 2015\" width=\"582\" height=\"776\" /></p>\n<div class=\'code-block code-block-3\' style=\'text-align:center;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-top:8px;margin-bottom:8px;\'><div class=\"adthrive-ad\" id=\"MyNaturalFamily_Mid_Post_2_600x250_300x250\">\r\n</div></div>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-34469\" src=\"http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-01-13-17.03.35-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"25 Tips &amp; Tricks from Our Disneyland Trip - details about the Frozen Event at Disneyland Winter/Spring 2015\" width=\"583\" height=\"777\" /></p>\n<p>I threw this picture in as an example of the freedom at Disneyland. We took this picture to show my husband how my kids were eating cotton candy and all sticky and loving it. They loved doing things like screaming as loud as they could on the rides. I mean, we spend tons of time in regular life telling them to be quiet all the time and this was a chance for them to just yell and it didn&#8217;t matter. A chance to eat cotton candy during the middle of the day when they normally very rarely get treats like that. The freedom to choose which ride they wanted to go on next. And just the overall feeling there of magic and that anything is possible if you will just believe.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-34470\" src=\"http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-01-14-15.32.45-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"25 Tips &amp; Tricks from Our Disneyland Trip\" width=\"523\" height=\"392\" srcset=\"http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-01-14-15.32.45-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-01-14-15.32.45-150x113.jpg 150w, http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-01-14-15.32.45-300x225.jpg 300w, http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-01-14-15.32.45-600x450.jpg 600w, http://cdn0.mynaturalfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-01-14-15.32.45-90x68.jpg 90w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px\" /></p>\n<p>No trip to Disneyland is complete without visiting the characters so here are some photos I took of my children with some of their favorite characters.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">TIP 19:</span></h2>\n<p>If you think your children would enjoy meeting the Disney characters bring a dollar store notebook with you so that they can have them get the characters signatures it made meeting a lot of fun for the kids.</p>\n<h2><span style=\"color: #800000;\">TIP 20:</span></h2>\n<p>If there are certain characters you want to meet make sure you look up the schedules and ask cast members.

	(50,'<p>When our first child was only about six months old, I knew my second child would be close to my first but we didn&#8217;t have enough money to do another adoption for  a while so we thought we better get started doing infertility treatments again.  I went and talked to a fertility specialist and we thought that donor sperm could end up being a good way to go, or spinning, I think it&#8217;s called, where they take the man&#8217;s sperm and try to get only the best sperm and inject it in you.  We were just starting to look in to the options.  My husband took a Monday off to do a sperm test so we could figure out better which direction to go in.  I was gone a lot of the day and when I could home my husband said the adoption agency called and to call them.  I called them and they said there was an African American woman in prison that decided at the last minute to place her cute little brown baby and the adoption agency had no one to place the child with and we could have  him if we wanted.  Seriously?  That&#8217;s it.  Well, since our adoption home study was good for a year and M was only 7.5 months old, we were adoption ready.  We didn&#8217;t even know this.  We actually had to re-do quite a bit of the paperwork and spent the rest of that week driving around trying to expedite paperwork and plan our trip to get our little boy.  Our brother-in-law was super-awesome and loaned us the money we needed for the adoption until we got the tax refund from our first adoption.</p>\n<p>We were at the adoption agency the next Monday morning so it was less than a week between when we found out about him until we got him.  Talk about fast!</p>\n<p>When things happen that fast, it&#8217;s really hard to prepare.  It was quite the scramble to find a few outfits and blankets, a car seat, etc. so we could go get him.  I remember putting him in some girlie blankets and clothes at first because we just didn&#8217;t have anything else (we just didn&#8217;t take any pictures of him in those clothes).  Plus, with both of my adopted children I didn&#8217;t buy much ahead of time because we didn&#8217;t know if it would be a girl or boy, what time of the year it would be and most importantly, I didn&#8217;t want to jinx anything.  For some reason I felt super self-conscience in the baby section of the store.  Like people were looking at me thinking, &#8220;Why is SHE here?  She doesn&#8217;t have a baby!&#8221;  Oh ya, cause I totally do that now to random women in the baby section.  NOT!</p>\n<p>Basically we arrived at the adoption office and got to hold him right away and hold him while we worked on the paperwork for a few hours and then he was ours.  We never got to meet the birth mother and his adoption has been fairly closed.  She sent a lot of letters at first but we always send them through the adoption agency.  Since she was in prison for like five years after he was placed with us, it was hard for her and she really missed him but once she got out of prison, I think it&#8217;s been a lot easy for her.</p>\n<p>With T we only had to stay in Florida for only about a week but we spent most of the time in our hotel room.  We had just seen all the sights and a newborn and an 8  month old are a lot harder to deal with than when we just had the newborn.  When we only only had the one child, I would often think that this whole baby thing is hard but not too bad and we did a lot and had a lot of freedom but once T came along, I pretty much lost my life.  I can&#8217;t remember most hardly anything for the first year or so of his life.  That&#8217;s also when my health started going downhill worse than ever.  All the stress of having two sweet, little babies and not sleeping very much was just too much for my body.  By the time T was about two years old, my RA was REALLY bad.</p>','http://www.mynaturalfamily.com/our-story/the-adoption-story-of-our-second-child/'),

And while they might look exactly the same to the uneducated beauty consumer, I’m willing to wager most of you reading this would see clear differences with the majority.&nbsp;Or, maybe that’s me justifying the fact <a href=\"http://stylecaster.com/beauty/confessions-of-a-makeup-hoarder/\" target=\"_blank\">I have a bit of a hoarding problem</a>.</p>\n<p>As for the <em>best</em> orange lipstick, though, I’m still very much undecided. My eye is typically drawn to the super-saturated, neon tangerine colors I so often see on the runway (most memorably at <a href=\"http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2014-ready-to-wear/rag-bone\" target=\"_blank\">Rag &amp; Bone Spring 2014’</a>s show, a beauty moment&nbsp;still referenced today) and the bold, sunny shade J.Crew made famous, although I’ll never kick a bright-red-leaning orange&nbsp;out of my makeup bag, either.</p>\n<p>The fact is, there’s a lot written about finding the most flattering orange for your skin tone, but I’ve found that most are more versatile than you’d expect so long as you look for shades that aren’t too brown to blue undertone-wise, which can make most of us&nbsp;look sallow, no matter what our complexion.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the issue of longevity—if I’m going orange, I’m going big. Meaning, I’m looking for the shade that not only says “hey world, I’m wearing lipstick today!”&nbsp;but one that stays put from my morning iced coffee to my evening glass of wine (if it can last through a couple slices of pizza too, I <em>know</em> she’s a keeper.)</p>\n<p>In the name of VIR (Very Important Research), I’ve spotlighted 12 shades of orange lipstick, from muted coral to juicy tangerine—both new and classic—and added color swatches and the scoop on how long they last.</p>\n<div id=\"oas_x70\" class=\"\"><div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/stylecaster/beauty/makeup_0__container__\" style=\"border: 0pt none;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/stylecaster/beauty/makeup_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/stylecaster/beauty/makeup_0\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"javascript:&quot;<html><body style=\'background:transparent\'></body></html>&quot;\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\"></iframe></div><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/stylecaster/beauty/makeup_0__hidden__\" title=\"\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/8352/stylecaster/beauty/makeup_0__hidden__\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"javascript:&quot;<html><body style=\'background:transparent\'></body></html>&quot;\" style=\"border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom; visibility: hidden; display: none;\"></iframe></div><p>Go, spring!</p>\n                                                                                                        ','http://stylecaster.com/beauty/best-orange-lipstick/'),

It was a random trip, in April, in Yosemite. Highlighs included:&nbsp;wild flowers, snow on the ground, and a large bear trying to eat the food that another campsite didn’t put in the bear lockers (PSA – put the food in the bear lockers!). It was a memorable trip and for the life of me I don’t know why we haven’t gotten our butts in gear to go again. Speaking of gear, this time we decided to do it right and research everything.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-14734\"></span></p>\n<p>We’re by no means backcountry campers, most of all because I think camping is kind of sort of (totally)&nbsp;about the food and backcountry camping with coolers and ice to keep food cold is just not possible. So, in the spirit of all things front country, our research started off with coolers.&nbsp;I wanted two things in a cooler: I wanted it to keep our food cold and I wanted it to look good, ie I wanted a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=white+cooler&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=673&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjFtYDAyoPNAhUT2WMKHeE5AY0Q_AUIBygC\" target=\"_blank\">white cooler</a>. Mike wanted two&nbsp;things too:&nbsp;He wanted it to stay as cold for as long as possible and for it to fit in the car.</p>\n<p class=\"retina-image\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14775\" src=\"http://s.iamafoodblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/yeticooler.jpg\" alt=\"camp gear guide - iamafoodblog.com\" width=\"1450\" height=\"968\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 267px;\"></p>\n<p><strong><strong>The Search for the Best Camp&nbsp;</strong>Cooler</strong></p>\n<p>I lusted after a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/20QVWj7\" target=\"_blank\">Yeti</a>&nbsp;because I’m a sucker for pretty, white boxy looking things. Apparently they’re the cooler that all the cool kids buy because they’re rotomolded&nbsp;so they&nbsp;keep your ice frozen for 5 days. Only problem is that it is kinda sort of a behemoth. Yes, there’s a small-ish one (Yeti Tundra 35), but when they say 35, which kind of sort of sounds like how many quarts of ice it’ll hold, they really mean 28. A bonus is that it is bear proof. That bonus comes with a price though because Yetis are hella expensive. And heavy.</p>\n<p>Speaking of heavy, this <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Pelican-ProGear-32-35Q-MC-WHT-Elite-Cooler/dp/B008HGKJXM/ref=sr_1_3?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464674476&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=pelican+cooler\" target=\"_blank\">Pelican cooler</a>&nbsp;was another contender. They’re actually the best rated cooler on the internet and they’re&nbsp;kind of sort of already on our radar because they make <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1XKZDaG\" target=\"_blank\">awesome camera cases</a> that are super protective for when you need to check your cameras.</p>\n<p>We looked at Igloos as well. Both Mike and I are kind of nostalgic about them because we both grew up with our parents using Igloo coolers on picnics/camping trips. They have a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/27ZSqbK\" target=\"_blank\">high end locker</a>&nbsp;that’s rotomolded, highly rated, and massive. I’m talking about at least a weeks worth of food for two people. If you’re not planning on going on a super long trip and you’re looking for a lighter alternative, the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/27ZSJ6r\" target=\"_blank\">Igloo Marine Ultra Quantum</a>&nbsp;is a nice little guy that comes with built in wheels.</p>\n<p>I felt like the princess and the pea only obsessing over coolers instead of a good night’s sleep, but&nbsp;I guess food &gt; sleep? Who am I kidding? The next thing we obsessively did research on was sleeping pads and sleeping bags.</p>\n<p class=\"retina-image\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14776\" src=\"http://s.iamafoodblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/zlite.jpg\" alt=\"camp gear guide - iamafoodblog.com\" width=\"1450\" height=\"968\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 267px;\"></p>\n<p><strong><strong>The Search for the Best Camp&nbsp;</strong>Sleeping Pads</strong></p>\n<p>Lots of people (my parents included) like packing an <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1THKWk1\" target=\"_blank\">air mattress</a> to go camping. Mike and I, on the other hand, didn’t want the bulk or the hassle of having to bring along an air pump. Plus we like firm mattresses, so it’s not much of a stretch to sleep on a foamie. At first we thought we’d do the classic blue foam pad. It’s lightweight, it’s affordable and kinda camp (both literally and kitschy). We also looked at an <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1THL7M9\" target=\"_blank\">egg crate foam sleeping pad</a>&nbsp;– not as compact as the blue foamie, but it’s supposed to keep you warm and they’re really light. Another option was a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1Uquhn3\" target=\"_blank\">self-inflatable pad</a>: cushy and kind of lightweight.</p>\n<p class=\"retina-image\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14777\" src=\"http://s.iamafoodblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/sleepingbag.jpg\" alt=\"camp gear guide - iamafoodblog.com\" width=\"1450\" height=\"968\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 267px;\"></p>\n<p><strong><strong>The Search for the Best </strong>Sleeping Bag</strong></p>\n<p>Even more important&nbsp;sleeping pads was a sleeping bag. We knew from the beginning that we didn’t want seperate sleeping bags – I’m a snuggler and sleeping solo in a sleeping bag just wasn’t going to fly. So, even though serious campers don’t really do this, and therefore there isn’t&nbsp;a huge amount of double sleeping bags, I did a massive amount of research to find the perfect couples sleeping bag.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1Uqx3bW\" target=\"_blank\">This one from Nemo</a>&nbsp;looks pretty fun because it has a sort of comforter thing that acts like a blanket. Plus in the world of double sleeping bags, it’s actually kind of light and it’s rated down to 30°F/-1°C. <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1THLLcz\" target=\"_blank\">This one is kind of similar</a>, but a bit more narrow, slightly more affordable, and looks a bit better – something about the fabric of the Nemo doesn’t sit well with me. The Sierra also is rated down to 27°F/-3°C, incase you run cold when you sleep. We also looked at <a href=\"http://amzn.to/27ZV29o\" target=\"_blank\">this guy</a>. He’s quite a bit more narrow than the other two, more of a twin size bed as opposed to the other two, which are more like double beds. And, if you’re planning on going somewhere really cold, he’s rated down to 0°F/<span>-18°C.</span></p>\n<p class=\"retina-image\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14778\" src=\"http://s.iamafoodblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/camptent.jpg\" alt=\"camp gear guide - iamafoodblog.com\" width=\"1450\" height=\"968\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 267px;\"></p>\n<p><strong><strong>The Search for the Best </strong>Tent</strong></p>\n<p>There’s a wild, wild world of tents out there. When looking for one, what most people want is low weight, just because they’re typically backcountry people. We weren’t as concerned about weight. I wanted something that was cute, of course, and Mike wanted something that he could stand up in. He was pushing for a four person tent, just for extra space, but I really love the look of smaller tents.</p>\n<p>One of the first tents we looked at was the <a href=\"http://amzn.to/20R3rqi\" target=\"_blank\">Optic 2.5</a>. It’s a super airy 3 season tent with a huge amount mesh for ventilation&nbsp;and&nbsp;2 full size doors. At 37 sq. ft. tent floor area, it has a bit more room in it than the standard 2-person tent, but it&nbsp;is on the “heavier” side at about 6 lbs. Then again, if you’re not going backcountry, this probably&nbsp;isn’t an issue.</p>\n<p>But, if we wanted to shell out a bit more money, there’s the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://amzn.to/1XaBr3a\" target=\"_blank\">Big Agnes Copper Spur UL2 Tent</a> which at just under 3lbs, is&nbsp;ultra light, but not quite as big at 29 sq. ft. It also has a lot of mesh (not as much as the Optic) for ventilation and 2 full sized rainbow doors. And, to make up for the smaller tent floor, the walls are a touch more vertical, giving you the illusion of more space – it isn’t quite as tall as the Optic though.</p>\n<p>While I was obsessed with researching light weight, small tents, Mike pretty much had his heart set on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.rei.com/product/894016/rei-kingdom-6-tent\" target=\"_blank\">REI Kingdom 6</a>, which is for – you got it – 6 people. I don’t even want to talk about how heavy it is. It does have standing room and you have the option of getting a “garage” for your gear, which is pretty cool, I must say. And there’s a awning that you can sit under when it’s raining – perfect for the Pacific Northwest. I’m thinking the <a href=\"https://www.rei.com/product/894015/rei-kingdom-4-tent\" target=\"_blank\">Kingdom 4</a> is much more manageable&nbsp;than then 6, but Mike really wants the 6?</p>\n<p>Then again, he&nbsp;was really pushing&nbsp;<a href=\"http://amzn.to/1THNbDU\" target=\"_blank\">this barn style tent</a>, and&nbsp;I’m pretty sure he was joking…at least I hope&nbsp;he was.</p>\n<p>Whew! That was a long ass post. Stay tuned for the next installment when I chat about chairs, camp stoves, and accessories. If you guys have any camp gear that you absolutely love, I’d love to hear about it.<br>\nxoxo steph</p>\n<p>PS – If you’re ever bored and want a kick, read camping reviews. I don’t know why, but I find them hilarious.<br>\n<span>PPS – These photos are really cheesy because Mike made them –minus the lead, which he did too &gt;_&lt;</span></p>\n	\n		\n				\n		<div class=\"article-comments\">\n			<div id=\"comments\">\n\n\n<div id=\"comment-form\">\n\n		\n	<div class=\"comment-container\">\n		<div class=\"comment-field\">\n			<b>Add a Comment</b>\n		</div>\n		<div class=\"comment-field comment-reply\">\n			<a rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"cancel-comment-reply-link\" href=\"/camp-gear-part-1/#respond\" style=\"display:none;\">Click here to cancel reply.</a>		</div>\n	</div>\n	\n	<form action=\"http://iamafoodblog.com/wp-comments-post.php\" method=\"post\" id=\"commentform\">\n	<textarea name=\"comment\" id=\"comment\" cols=\"58\" rows=\"10\" tabindex=\"1\"></textarea>\n	\n	<div id=\"commenter_info\">\n		<div id=\"register-comment-container\">\n		<h4>Please Register</h4>\n		<div class=\"register-comment commenter-name\">\n			\n			<input type=\"text\" name=\"author\" id=\"author\" value=\"\" size=\"22\" tabindex=\"2\" aria-required=\"true\">\n			<label for=\"author\">Your Name</label> <small>(required)</small>\n		</div>\n		<div class=\"register-comment commenter-email\">	\n			\n			<input type=\"text\" name=\"email\" id=\"email\" value=\"\" size=\"22\" tabindex=\"3\" aria-required=\"true\">\n			<label for=\"email\">Your Email</label> <small>(hidden, required)</small>\n		</div>\n		<div class=\"register-comment commenter-email\">\n			\n			<input type=\"text\" name=\"url\" id=\"url\" value=\"\" size=\"22\" tabindex=\"4\">\n			<label for=\"url\">Your Blog URL</label> <small>(optional)</small>\n		</div>		\n	</div>	\n	<div class=\"post_comment\"><input name=\"submit\" type=\"submit\" id=\"submit\" tabindex=\"5\" value=\"Post my comment\"></div>\n		</div>\n	\n	<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"comment_post_ID\" value=\"14734\" id=\"comment_post_ID\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"comment_parent\" id=\"comment_parent\" value=\"0\">\n	<p style=\"display: none;\"><input type=\"hidden\" id=\"akismet_comment_nonce\" name=\"akismet_comment_nonce\" value=\"099b120ba2\"></p><p style=\"display: none;\"></p>	\n	<input type=\"hidden\" id=\"ak_js\" name=\"ak_js\" value=\"1465714625152\"></form>\n	\n		\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"postcomments\" id=\"comments\">\n	<h3><em>12  Comments</em>	\n	\n	</h3>\n\n	<div id=\"comments-list\">\n		<ol class=\"commentlist\">\n		   <li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-110865\">\n     <div id=\"comment-110865\">\n      \n      \n     \n\n      <p>Sadly, I’ve never gone camping.

Up in Maine. Last year when we went, we were totally not prepared and my husband realized that 1) he couldn’t start the fire with just matches and wet wood and 2) he doesn’t own a sleeping bag. Good thing to realize both of these things when we already got to the campsite and had our tent set up and were all ready to make some s’mores!

I have vivid memories of me as a kid, staying up late, watching the playoffs. I didn&#8217;t really understand the intricacies of the game – I still don&#8217;t, but I did know that when the puck went into the net, it was time to cheer. The gameplay didn&#8217;t matter to me so much, it was more the fact that my whole family hung out together, in the family room, glued to Hockey Night in Canada, united by our love for the game.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-14669\"></span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14673\" src=\"http://s.iamafoodblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IAM_3425.jpg\" alt=\"perfect onion rings - www.iamafoodblog.com\" width=\"1450\" height=\"968\" /></p>\n<p>As a Canadian, hockey is part of our culture. Growing up in Edmonton, ice skating was practically curriculum at school and in the summer, everyone, me included, played street hockey. So, it should come as no surprise to you that Stanley Cup parties are a thing. A looooooong time ago, when the Canucks were in the Playoffs, I threw a cereal party where at first, we watched old school cartoons, but once it was time for the game, we switched over.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14673\" src=\"http://s.iamafoodblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IAM_3443.jpg\" alt=\"perfect onion rings - www.iamafoodblog.com\" width=\"1450\" height=\"968\" /></p>\n<p>I really don&#8217;t throw Stanley Cup parties often, just because I&#8217;m kind of a fair weather fan. It&#8217;s bad, I know, but winning is so much fun and losing, well, isn&#8217;t. But, at least with this Stanley Cup onion ring tower, you&#8217;re going to be winning no matter what!</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14673\" src=\"http://s.iamafoodblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IAM_3463.jpg\" alt=\"perfect onion rings - www.iamafoodblog.com\" width=\"1450\" height=\"968\" /></p>\n<p>Onion rings are the perfect thing to eat while watching the game. They&#8217;re savory, crunchy, and perfectly dippable. I&#8217;m kind of obsessed with towers of onion rings and Mike came up with the brilliant idea of arranging the tower into a Stanley Cup shape. I didn&#8217;t think it was going to work out, with the precariousness of onion ring shapes and all, but Mike did an excellent job of engineering a Stanley Cup onion ring tower. I was seriously impressed!</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14671\" src=\"http://s.iamafoodblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IAM_3400w.jpg\" alt=\"perfect onion rings - www.iamafoodblog.com\" width=\"2880\" height=\"1922\" /></p>\n<p>I was also impressed by how easy it was to use the Vitamix to whip up a spicy jalapeño aioli for dipping. Usually I make my aioli by hand, with a whisk, but with this spicy guy I wanted the jalapeño to be blended in. The aioli whipped up in a flash. The onion rings, on the other hand, take a little bit of babying, but are so, so worth it. They&#8217;re based off of a <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1XyE7pF\" target=\"_blank\">J.

I love any excuse to make a cake, but a birthday is the best! I wanted to make a cake that was something that she liked, but was also unexpected. When prompted, she requested a London Fog – earl grey tea with vanilla – cake. Luckily, there was a recipe for earl grey buttercream in Tessa&#8217;s new book, <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1qDLUW5\" target=\"_blank\">Layered</a>, so that was, well, a piece of cake.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-14500\"></span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14511\" src=\"http://s.iamafoodblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IAM_2656.jpg\" alt=\"vanilla earl grey london fog cake - www.iamafoodblog.com\" width=\"1450\" height=\"968\" /></p>\n<p>The unexpected part, however, took quite a bit of brainstorming. I knew I wanted to do a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=drippy+cake&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=673&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiI29GoovHMAhUH0YMKHf3_C8YQ_AUIBigB\" target=\"_blank\">drippy cake</a> but I also wanted to add a bit of crunch. Mike and were chatting while driving, trying to brainstorm something fun to put on top. We thought about mini donuts, churros, cookies&#8230;the list goes on, but I wasn&#8217;t feeling any of them. After a couple of red lights of deep thought, I said, &#8220;but what does Betty love?&#8221;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14511\" src=\"http://s.iamafoodblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IAM_2698.jpg\" alt=\"vanilla earl grey london fog cake - www.iamafoodblog.com\" width=\"1450\" height=\"968\" /></p>\n<p>Mike&#8217;s answer was immediate: chips. And it&#8217;s absolutely true, Betty is a chip fiend. Betty&#8217;s been known to eat entire family size bags of chips, for dinner. She regularly goes on all chip diets where she actually manages to lose weight. And once, when she was feeling particularly down, I left a surprise care package at her door, full of – you got it – chips.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14504\" src=\"http://s.iamafoodblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IAM_2913.jpg\" alt=\"vanilla earl grey london fog cake - www.iamafoodblog.com\" width=\"700\" height=\"933\" /><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-14507\" src=\"http://s.iamafoodblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IAM_3018.jpg\" alt=\"vanilla earl grey london fog cake - www.iamafoodblog.com\" width=\"700\" height=\"933\" /></p>\n<p>So, this is the London fog, caramelized kettle chip (kinda like caramel corn) birthday cake I made for Betty.

These fictional board members debate a series of questions Usdin poses, and the audience weighs in by casting votes via smart phone app.</p>\n<p>This year’s panelists brought together a variety of perspectives. J. Leighton Read, a partner at Alloy Ventures, served as CEO. Hank Greely, from Stanford’s Law School; Pamela Gavin, of the National Organization of Rare Disorders; and the FDA’s Richard Moscicki took on the roles of board members of a company called iCures. This pretend company has not one, but two potential leads for serious illnesses with unmet needs – Alzheimer’s and type 2 diabetes. The board debated how to allocate limited resources, how to price the therapy, and whether to in-license a drug and quadruple its price (simply because they could).</p>\n<p>The board agreed on a few things, such as securing partnerships to finance their drugs. They debated the wisdom of keeping the price of a drug lower than it might receive in the open market, as a way of insuring greater uptake, which ultimately would bring greater rewards to the company (and would be a good PR play), although they mused over whether there were any good models for determining the kinetics of uptake for maximizing profits.</p>\n<p>Yet the issue of transparency scored the highest cohesion – to a person, the board was against supporting legislation that requires it, though not entirely for the same reasons. The arguments included the unfairness of singling out one industry for scrutiny, although one board member pointed out that iPhones and drugs are quite different animals, as not everyone wants or needs an iPhone, but everyone at some time in their life will need healthcare. And there was the argument that the data might not make much sense to the public anyway, given the complexity of developing a drug and bringing it to market. And finally, quite apart from ethical considerations, there was the idea that it is just plain bad policy for the government to get involved with pricing drugs (although we might be the only industrialized nation that doesn’t allow it in some form or another.)</p>\n<p>So it’s a pity that more people didn’t attend this panel. In general, it seems the emphasis on ethics has taken a back seat at BIO this year. There was a time when BIO had a robust ethics track, but here in San Francisco the offerings are paltry. Is this because there simply weren’t many submitted, or because BIO’s selection committee did not see fit to choose them? Either way, ethical issues are at the forefront for a public that already views drug makers unfavorably. The BIO convention needs more panels like this, and fewer sessions in which industry folks pat each other on the back for a job well done.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nbt/about/about_eds/index.html#laura\">Laura DeFrancesco</a></p>\n																	','http://blogs.nature.com/tradesecrets/2016/06/07/snubbing-ethics'),

And not just in one place, but in two distinct cases: a woman with a urinary tract infection (UTI) in Pennsylvania, <a href=\"http://aac.asm.org/content/early/2016/05/25/AAC.01103-16.full.pdf+html\">reported in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy</a>, and a positive sample taken from a <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/blog/2016/05/26/early-detection-new-antibiotic-resistance.html\">pig’s intestine </a>as part of the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/narms/about/index.html\">NARMS</a>), which&nbsp;tracks resistant bacteria related to retail meat products. Not surprising, not unexpected, but still, not good.</p>\n<p>Colistin is an <a href=\"http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/40/9/1333.full\">old antibiotic</a>.&nbsp;Dating back to the 1950s, it’s been used sparingly over the decades because it can cause serious damage to the kidneys and nervous system. It’s also typically administered intravenously in humans, so you can’t just pop a colistin pill and be sent home from the doctor. Newer preparations appear to be safer, and because of the problem with antibiotic resistance in general and limited treatment options for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections in particular, colistin has seen a new life in the last decade or so as a last line of defense against some of these almost-untreatable infections.</p>\n<p>Because of its sparing use in humans, resistance has not been much of an issue until recently. And while human use is relatively rare compared to other types of antibiotics, in animals, the story is different. Because colistin is old and cheap, it’s used as an <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2015/11/21/mcr-gene-colistin/\">additive to feed in Chinese livestock</a>, to make them grow faster and fatter. (<a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2015/09/10/antibiotic-resistance-myths-and-misunderstandings/\">We do this here in the U.S. too</a>, but using different antibiotics than&nbsp;colistin). So as would be expected, use of this antibiotic led to the evolution and spread of a resistant strain, due to the presence of the MCR-1 gene. By the first time they saw this resistance, <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(15)00424-7/fulltext\">it was already present </a>in 20% of the pigs they tested near Shanghai, and 15% of the raw meat samples they tested. In this case, the gene is on a plasmid, which makes it easier to spread to other types of bacteria. To date, most of the reports of MCR-1 have been in <em>E. coli</em>, but it’s also been found in <em><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27090630\">Salmonella</a>&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;Klebsiella pneunoniae</em>–all gut bacteria that can be spread from animals via contaminated food products, or person-to-person when someone carrying the bacterium doesn’t wash their hands after using the bathroom.</p>\n<p>So a question becomes, how exactly did it get here? And that’s very difficult to say right now. The hospital where the human case was reported notes that the patient reported no travel history in the past 5 months (so it’s unlikely that she traveled to China, for instance, and picked up the gene or bacterium carrying it&nbsp;there). The hospital says they’ve not found other MCR-1&nbsp;positive isolates from other patients, but also that they’ve only been testing specimens for 3 weeks, so…yeah. Hard to say. People and animals (like the tested pig) can carry <em>E. coli</em> or other species that harbor MCR-1<i>&nbsp;</i>in their gut without becoming ill, so it&nbsp;may have been in the population for awhile (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27168587\">as they’ve seen in Brazil</a>) before it came to the attention of medical researchers. Perhaps it’s been circulating in some of our meat products, or spreading in a chain of miniscule transfers of shit from person to person to person to person, for longer than we realize. Or both.</p>\n<p>I was asked on Twitter yesterday, “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GeckoVox/status/735909886869938176\">Should I panic today or put that off until next week?</a>” I’m not an advocate of panic myself, but I do think this is yet another concern and another hit on our antibiotic arsenal. It’s not widespread in this country and as mentioned, colistin is luckily not a first-line drug, so it won’t affect all *that* many people–for now, at least.</p>\n<p>But.</p>\n<p>There are already <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(16)00056-6/fulltext?rss=yes\">papers out there</a> <a href=\"http://aac.asm.org/content/early/2016/05/17/AAC.00440-16.long\">showing bacteria that</a> have both NDM-1 (or related variants) and MCR-1&nbsp;genes. NDM-1 is a gene that provides resistance to another class of last-resort antibiotics, the carbapenems. (Maryn McKenna has covered this extensively <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/search?query=NDM-1&amp;cx=010858178366868418930%3Afk33zkiunj8&amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;ie=UTF-8\">on her blog</a>). When carbapenems fail, treatment with colistin sometimes works. But if the bacterium is resistant to both colistin and carbapenems, well…not good. That hasn’t been reported yet in the U.S., but it’s only a matter of time, as <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2016/05/26/colistin-r-9/\">McKenna notes</a>.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t mean that we’re out of antibiotics (yet) or that everyone who has one of these resistant infections will be unable to find a treatment that works (yet). But we’re inching ever closer to those days, one resistant bacterium at a time.</p>\n','http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2016/05/27/mcr-1-has-been-identified-in-the-united-states-what-is-it-and-what-does-it-mean/'),
	(60,'\n			<p>Back in November, <a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/thepumphandle/2015/11/23/findings-from-china-show-the-post-antibiotics-future-approaching/\">researchers from China reported finding a gene that confers resistance to the last-resort antibiotic colistin</a> in several <em>E. coli</em> isolates, and warned that pan-drug resistant Enterobacteriaceae — a family of bacteria that includes common foodborne illness culprits <em>E. coli</em> and<em> Salmonella</em> — “is inevitable and will ultimately become global.” As researchers in other countries began examining stored isolates for the gene, MCR-1, they found it. <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2016/05/27/superbug-antimicrobial-resistance-explainer/\">STAT’s Helen Branswell reports</a> it “has been found in many European countries, parts of Asia, North Africa, South America, and North America, including Canada.”</p>\n<p>Last week, <a href=\"http://aac.asm.org/content/early/2016/05/25/AAC.01103-16.full.pdf+html\">researchers from the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research reported in <em>Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy</em></a> that they’ve found MCR-1 in the U.S. Specifically, they identified it in <em>E. coli</em> cultured from the urine of a 49-year-old Pennsylvania woman with symptoms of a urinary tract infection. Patrick McGann and his co-authors note, “the patient reported no travel history within the prior 5 months.” And they found the gene within three weeks of launching systematic efforts to look for it. <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2016/05/26/colistin-r-9/\">Maryn McKenna reports at Germination</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Pennsylvania woman’s diagnosis occurred thanks to a system set up within the DOD after MCR was discovered. Since last fall, any E. coli that was already resistant to a family of drugs known as ESBLs (extended-spectrum beta-lactams), as hers was, has been sent up the chain to Walter Reed, to be scrutinized for colistin resistance. That kind of systematic checking for antibiotic resistance, known as active surveillance, is rare in the United States. Most civilian surveillance systems are patchy; they focus only on foodborne illnesses, or rely on physicians or labs to report diagnoses, or draw from a few state health departments with already well-funded labs.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In addition to this discovery by the Department of Defense, <a href=\"http://www.hhs.gov/blog/2016/05/26/early-detection-new-antibiotic-resistance.html\">an HHS.gov blog post reports</a>, “A USDA and HHS search for colistin-resistant bacteria in food animals, retail meats and people also has found colistin-resistant E. coli in a single sample from a pig intestine.” Over the past year, these three agencies have been involved in surveillance and research activities as part of President Obama’s <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/27/fact-sheet-obama-administration-releases-national-action-plan-combat-ant\">National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria</a>.</p>\n<p>MCR-1 is of particular concern because it’s carried on a plasmid, a small piece of DNA that can easily transfer from one strain of bacteria to another. While the bacteria from the Pennsylvania woman was susceptible to some antibiotics, the fear is that a separate multi-drug resistant bacteria — like <a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/thepumphandle/2013/03/14/sounding-the-alarm-on-nightmare-bacteria-cre/\">“nightmare bacteria” carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)</a> — could acquire MCR-1. In other words, we could soon be facing bacteria that are resistant to all antibiotics currently available. In such a “<a href=\"https://medium.com/@fernnews/imagining-the-post-antibiotics-future-892b57499e77#.x7d2aqnf2\">post-antibiotics future</a>,” medical procedures that are now routine, like dialysis or hip replacements, could carry the risk of untreatable infections.</p>\n<p>The fact that US agencies discovered MCR-1 in a human patient and animal sample is a sign of success for their new surveillance efforts. CDC and USDA are investigating possible sources of these infections and working to identify any other cases. Worldwide, surveillance efforts have succeded in identifying MCR-1 in samples from a variety of sources in several diffeent countries. Where we’re lagging, though, is in adressing the root of the problem: inappropriate use of antibiotics. <a href=\"http://publichealth.gwu.edu/content/statement-news-dangerous-superbug-gene-discovered-nearly-20-countries-now-us\">Lance Price of the Antibiotic Resistance Action Center </a>(ARAC) at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health (where I also work) had this statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Much like in the U.S., Chinese livestock producers are overusing antibiotics to prevent diseases and make animals grow faster. Colistin is widely used in Chinese livestock and this use likely led to the evolution of mcr-1. This promiscuous gene can be transferred from bacterium to bacterium, increasing the likelihood that it will find its way to CRE. History shows that mobile resistance genes can spread quickly around the world, silently riding in people, animals, and food. We’re watching this scenario play out in real time.</p>\n<p>Scientists rang the alarm bells about mcr-1 back in November, but the attention didn’t last much longer than an average news cycle. Now we find that this gene has made its way into pigs and people in the U.S. If our leaders were waiting to act until they could see the cliff’s edge—I hope this opens their eyes to the abyss that lies before us. It’s time to act. We need a global agreement to end the abuse of all medically important antibiotics in livestock production in the U.S. and around the world.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I wish I could express some optimism about the likelihood of US leaders responding to this threat with the force and urgency it deserves. But if <a href=\"http://scienceblogs.com/thepumphandle/2016/05/27/state-local-public-health-loses-critical-funding-because-congress-fails-to-act-on-zika-yes-we-should-be-scared/\">our current Congress can’t even approve sufficient funds for Zika virus response</a>, when the virus is already circulating in Puerto Rico, I fear they won’t consider the MCR-1 discovery to be the wake-up call it ought to be.</p>\n','http://scienceblogs.com/thepumphandle/2016/06/01/us-researchers-find-bacteria-resistant-to-last-resort-drug/'),

These traditional Thai tattoos are engraved into skin with a long metal spike or bamboo sharpened to a point. </p>\n<p>The needle is dipped into ink and repeatedly jabbed through your flesh by hand.</p>\n<p>Monks will often choose a sacred design as well as the location of your tattoo based on your aura. This sounded perfect! <strong>I’ve had trouble picking a tattoo, so why not let a monk choose for me? </strong></p>\n<p></p><center>\n<div id=\"alert-blue\">\nNeed a place to stay in Bangkok? <a href=\"http://www.booking.com/city/th/bangkok.en-gb.html?aid=933974\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Click Here For Accommodation Deals</a></div>\n<p></p></center><p></p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Asia/Thailand/i-FrLQ7RR/1/XL/sak-yant-tattoo-offering-XL.jpg\" title=\"Donations of Cigarettes, Flowers, and Incense\" alt=\"Donations Sak Yant Thailand\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Donations of Cigarettes, Flowers, and Incense</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Wat Bang Phra Temple</h2>\n<p>The best place in Thailand to receive a Sak Yant tattoo is a Buddhist temple called <a href=\"http://www.wat-bang-phra.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Wat Bang Phra</a>. It’s located about 40 minutes West of Bangkok. </p>\n<p>For hundreds of years the temple has been a pilgrimage site for Thai people wanting to receive the protection of a magic tattoo.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s also home to the most famous Sak Yant practicing monk in Thailand, Master Luang Pi Nunn.</strong></p>\n<p>The grounds of Wat Bang Phra are composed of a series of beautifully ornate temples surrounded by colorful statues. I made my way towards the tattoo building located in back.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Asia/Thailand/i-MW8RHL9/1/XL/sak-yant-monk-tattoo-XL.jpg\" title=\"Master Luang Pi Nunn\" alt=\"Luang Pi Nunn Thailand\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Master Luang Pi Nunn</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Cigarettes As Payment?</h2>\n<p>Outside the entrance I purchased a temple offering consisting of orchid flowers, incense sticks, and menthol cigarettes for 75 baht ($2.40 US) before removing my shoes and heading inside.</p>\n<p><strong>Everyone is expected to present these simple gifts to the monk as payment for a Sak Yant tattoo.</strong> The items are then recycled so the process can be repeated, with money from the sales helping with upkeep of the temple.</p>\n<p>An old man led me into a dark room filled with dusty golden Buddha statues.

Master Luang Pi Nunn is in demand here, and etches up to 50 Sak Yant tattoos a day. If you don’t visit the temple early enough, you may not get one.</p>\n<p>Due to some miscommunication with a moto-taxi driver that morning, I arrived about an hour later than expected. I’d just have to wait my turn and hope for the best! </p>\n<p>So I found a spot on the floor and attempted to make myself comfortable over the next 4 hours. The long wait allowed me to witness many others receive their own tattoos.</p>\n<p>Eventually Luang Pi Nunn took a break while the rest of us continued to sit in silence, listening to bird song and cats meowing outside. By now I was up front though, with a great view of his tattoo workspace — <strong>and I have to admit it was a bit shocking!</strong></p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Asia/Thailand/i-sk9zXvP/1/XL/sak-yant-tattoo-workspace-XL.jpg\" title=\"Not Exactly a Sterile Workspace...\" alt=\"Tattoo Workspace Thailand\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Not Exactly a Sterile Workspace…</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Sak Yant Tattoo Safety</h2>\n<p>The safety of Sak Yant is debateable. It can be a risky practice. The needle itself is usually wiped with an alcohol pad after each tattoo. Or it might be placed in a bottle of alcohol while a separate needle is used for the next person. But the same pot of ink is used with everyone, and blood can mix with the ink. </p>\n<p>This opens up the possibility of contracting HIV or Hepatitis. There are no hard statistics though. </p>\n<p>After getting a close look at his tools, I got a bit nervous and briefly thought about backing out. The workspace consisted of a few cushions surrounded by bloody rolled-up pieces of toilet paper, a nasty bucket of inky water, old plastic bottles full of rubbing alcohol, and grime caked onto the walls…</p>\n<p>I’d also just watched at least 12 people get jabbed with the same couple of needles. And who knows how many went before I arrived.</p>\n<p>But then I realized that if it was truly dangerous, there wouldn’t be so many people waiting in line to get one. Right?</p>\n<p><strong>Or is the whole room just full of crazy people with a death wish?</strong></p>\n<p></p><center>\n<div style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Asia/Thailand/i-XwkqCqd/1/XL/sak-yant-tattoo-needle-XL.jpg\" title=\"The Needle\" alt=\"Sak Yant Needle Thailand\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Needle</p>\n</div>\n<p></p></center><p></p>\n<h2>Snake Venom Ink!</h2>\n<p>I didn’t have long to ponder though, as the monk soon returned and it was my turn to help hold the next person’s skin while he worked. This gave me an excellent view of the whole process. It was mesmerizing to watch.</p>\n<p>Suddenly it was my turn. Pulling off my shirt, I respectfully bowed three times before turning my back on the man who was about to repeatedly poke a sharp needle into my skin. </p>\n<p>Occasionally a monk will deem a person unfit to receive a Yant if they don’t take it seriously, refusing to work on them.</p>\n<p><strong>Two local guys held my skin tight as I braced for first-blood.</strong> Not knowing what image I was about to get. </p>\n<p>Each monk concocts his own special blend of magic tattoo ink too. The recipe is secret, but is thought to contain Chinese charcoal, snake venom, palm oil, and even human remains!</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Asia/Thailand/i-5bbmKCc/1/XL/sak-yant-traditional-tattoo-XL.jpg\" title=\"Receiving My Sak Yant Tattoo\" alt=\"Sak Yant Monk Tattoo Thailand\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Receiving My Sak Yant Tattoo!</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Taking The Pain</h2>\n<p>When the needle first punctured my skin, it felt like a bee sting. Followed quickly by a swarm of bees launching a full-scale attack. </p>\n<p>My muscles tensed up and I began to sweat. Squeezing a pillow in my lap while attempting to look tough for the 40 Thais attentively watching the foreigner for any signs of weakness.</p>\n<p>But surprisingly it didn’t hurt as much as I thought it would. Initially I was afraid my eyes would water, or worse, I’d pass out in front of a room full of people…</p>\n<p>Yet after only 10 minutes and a thousand needle strikes later my new Sak Yant was nearly finished! </p>\n<p><strong>To complete the sacred tattoo, Luang Pi Nunn chants a Kataa (or magic spell), and blows it into the design unleashing its power.</strong></p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Asia/Thailand/i-Hh3ZZkS/1/XL/sak-yant-gao-yord-XL.jpg\" title=\"Finished: Gao Yord (9 Spire) Magic Tattoo\" alt=\"Gao Yord Sak Yant Tattoo Thailand\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Finished: Gao Yord (9 Spire) Magic Tattoo</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Yant Gao Yord</h2>\n<p>So which tattoo did the monk give me? It’s called the <em>Gao Yord</em>, or 9 Spire. A powerful and sacred tattoo that protects the wearer from violent physical attacks and magic assaults. It’s also supposed to bring good luck.</p>\n<p>The 9 spires represent the 9 peaks of Mount Meru — a legendary mountain from Buddhist and Hindu mythology that is thought to be the center of the universe.</p>\n<p>Atop each peak sits a small Buddha, with the spirals above them representing the path to enlightenment.</p>\n<p>Inside the boxes are symbols written in <em>Khom</em>, an ancient Cambodian alphabet, but the language itself is <em>Pali Sanskrit</em>. The same mantra is actually written on each side. A mirrored image of itself. It reads: Gu Ti Gu Ya Tha Saa Wae Taa Saa Gu – Gu Gu Ti Saa Tha Ya Gu Saa Taa Wae</p>\n<p><strong>Apparently there are also 11 special rules that go with my Sak Yant:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I can’t eat star fruit, pumpkin, or any other ‘gourd’ vegetable. <em><strong>(no more pumpkin pie?!)</strong></em></li>\n<li>I can’t have a lover who’s already married. <em><strong>(sounds reasonable)</strong></em></li>\n<li>It’s absolutely forbidden for me to slander anybody’s mother. <em><strong>(no problem)</strong></em></li>\n<li>I can’t eat food from a wedding, or funeral banquet. <em><strong>(well that sucks)</strong></em></li>\n<li>I can’t eat left-overs. <em><strong>(I’d love to know why…)</strong></em></li>\n<li>I shouldn’t duck under a washing line, or an overhanging building. <em><strong>(um, ok)</strong></em></li>\n<li>I definitely shouldn’t duck under a Thaanii banana tree. <em><strong>(harvesting bananas isn’t a hobby)</strong></em></li>\n<li>I can’t cross a single head bridge; but large or small bridges are not forbidden. <em><strong>(no idea what this means)</strong></em></li>\n<li>I shouldn’t sit on a ceramic urn. Especially a cracked, or broken one. <em><strong>(do toilets count?)</strong></em></li>\n<li>I can’t let a woman lie on top of me, or sit on top either. <em><strong>(shit!)</strong></em></li>\n<li>I can’t brush by the blouse or skirt of a woman, especially during the menstruation period. <em><strong>(how am I supposed to know?)</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Asia/Thailand/i-MzDwf7m/1/XL/gao-yord-tattoo-XL.jpg\" title=\"All Healed Up\" alt=\"Sak Yant Tattoo Thailand\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">All Healed Up</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Would I Do It Again?</h2>\n<p>Yes. Absolutely. I may get another one too. In fact I’ve learned that the magic needs to be replenished each year with a fresh blessing by the monk. So I’ll have to go back anyway.</p>\n<p>Thai people from all levels of society take the practice very seriously, and many cover their bodies with Sak Yant tattoos.</p>\n<p>You’ll frequently find the designs on soldiers, doctors, monks, actors, and politicians as well as criminals and mafia assassins. </p>\n<p>Many women also get them. <a href=\"http://www.pattayadailynews.com/en/2011/06/02/yantra-tattooing-in-thailand/\" target=\"_blank\">Angelina Jolie</a> is probably the most famous. But because it’s forbidden for monks to touch female flesh, they use a cloth or gloves to prevent contact. </p>\n<p>Some people choose to receive an invisible tattoo, using palm oil on the needle rather than ink. </p>\n<p>I’m very happy with my new Sak Yant, it was an extraordinary experience that I’ll never forget. Especially with this permanent souvenir on my back. ★</p>\n<p></p><center>\n<div id=\"alert-blue\">Worried about needle safety?

These are the best travel tips I’ve discovered along the way.</p>\n<p>It all started when I took a one-way flight from Miami to Guatemala City, leaping nervously into the unknown and leaving much of my old life behind while <a href=\"https://expertvagabond.com/about/\">embarking on an epic travel adventure around the world</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s been a wild ride, and I’ve learned a lot since I first left. To celebrate my 4 year “travelversary”, I’ve decided to share a collection of my best and most useful travel tips to help inspire you to make travel a priority in your life.</p>\n<p><em>Feel free to share your own best travel tips at the end!</em></p>\n<h2>1. Patience Is Important</h2>\n<p>Don’t sweat the stuff you can’t control. Life is much too short to be angry &amp; annoyed all the time. Did you miss your bus? No worries, there will be another one. ATMs out of money? Great! Take an unplanned road trip over to the next town and explore. Sometimes freakouts happen regardless. </p>\n<p><strong>Just take a deep breath and remind yourself that it could be worse.</strong></p>\n<h2>2. Wake Up Early</h2>\n<p>Rise at sunrise to have the best attractions all to yourself while avoiding crowds. It’s also a magical time for photos due to soft diffused light, and usually easier to interact with locals. Sketchy areas are less dangerous in the morning too. Honest hardworking people wake up early; touts, scammers, and criminals sleep in.</p>\n<p class=\"readnext\">READ MORE: <a href=\"http://expertvagabond.com/common-travel-scams/\">15 Common Travel Scams</a></p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Oceania/Fiji/i-QSXpBMf/7/900x900/skydive-900x900.jpg\" title=\"Travel Tip: Laugh at Yourself\" alt=\"Favorite Travel Tips\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Travel Tip: Laugh at Yourself</p>\n</div>\n<h2>3. Laugh At Yourself</h2>\n<p>You will <a href=\"http://expertvagabond.com/skydiving-fiji/\">definitely look like a fool</a> many times when traveling to new places. Rather than get embarrassed, laugh at yourself. Don’t be afraid to screw up, and don’t take life so seriously. </p>\n<p>Once a whole bus full of Guatemalans laughed with glee when I forced our driver to stop so I could urgently pee on the side of the road. Returning to the bus and laughing with them gave me new friends for the rest of the journey.</p>\n<h2>4. Stash Extra Cash</h2>\n<p>Cash is king around the world. To cover your ass in an emergency, make sure to stash some in a few different places. I recommend at least a couple hundred dollars worth. If you lose your wallet, your card stops working, or the ATMs run out of money, you’ll be glad you did. </p>\n<p>Some of my favorite stash spots include socks, under shoe inserts, a toiletry bag, around the frame of a backpack, even sewn behind a patch on your bag.</p>\n<p class=\"readnext\">READ MORE: <a href=\"http://expertvagabond.com/travel-banking-101/\">How To Protect Your Money Traveling</a></p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Africa/South-Africa/i-DSwqvT7/3/900x900/khula-township-family-900x900.jpg\" title=\"Travel Tip: Meet Local People\" alt=\"My Best Travel Tips\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Travel Tip: Meet Local People</p>\n</div>\n<h2>5. Meet Local People</h2>\n<p>Make it a point to avoid other travelers from time to time and start conversations with local people. Basic English is spoken widely all over the world, so it’s easier to communicate with them than you might think, especially when you combine hand gestures and body language. </p>\n<p>Learn from those who live in the country you’re visiting. People enrich your travels more than sights do.</p>\n<h2>6. Pack A Scarf</h2>\n<p>I happen to use a <a href=\"http://expertvagabond.com/shemagh-keffiyeh/\">shemagh</a>, but <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1N10CuZ\" target=\"_blank\">sarongs</a> also work great. This simple piece of cotton cloth is one of my most useful travel accessories with many different practical applications. It’s great for sun protection, a makeshift towel, carrying stuff around, an eye mask, and much more.</p>\n<p>I can’t tell you how many times a scarf has come in handy around the world.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Central-America/Nicaragua/i-WXRVWV6/4/900x900/granada-buildings-blue-900x900.jpg\" title=\"Travel Tip: Observe Daily Life\" alt=\"My Best Travel Tips\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Travel Tip: Observe Daily Life</p>\n</div>\n<h2>7. Observe Daily Life</h2>\n<p>If you really want to get a feel for the pulse of a place, I recommend spending a few hours sitting in a park or on a busy street corner by yourself just watching day to day life happen in front of you. </p>\n<p>Slow down your thoughts and pay close attention to the details around you. The smells, the colors, human interactions, and sounds. It’s a kind of meditation — and you’ll see stuff you never noticed before.</p>\n<h2>8. Back Everything Up</h2>\n<p>When my <a href=\"http://expertvagabond.com/tracking-stolen-laptop/\">laptop computer was stolen in Panama</a>, having most of my important documents and photos backed up saved my ass. Keep both digital and physical copies of your passport, visas, driver’s license, birth certificate, health insurance card, serial numbers, and important phone numbers ready to go in case of an emergency. </p>\n<p>Backup your files &amp; photos on an external hard drive as well as online with software like <a href=\"http://expertvagabond.com/go/backblaze\" target=\"_blank\">Backblaze</a>.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Central-America/Guatemala/i-8sWdS5n/1/900x900/volcano-santiaguito-exploding-eruption-900x900.jpg\" title=\"Travel Tip: Take Lots of Photos\" alt=\"My Best Travel Tips\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Travel Tip: Take Lots of Photos</p>\n</div>\n<h2>9. Take Lots Of Photos</h2>\n<p>You may only see these places &amp; meet these people once in your lifetime. Remember them forever with plenty of photos. Don’t worry about looking like a “tourist”. Are you traveling to look cool? No one cares. Great photos are the ultimate souvenir. </p>\n<p>They don’t cost anything, they’re easy to share with others, and they don’t take up space in your luggage. Just remember once you have your shot to get out from behind the lens and <a href=\"http://expertvagabond.com/iceland-photography/\" target=\"_blank\">enjoy the view</a>.</p>\n<h2>10. There’s Always A Way</h2>\n<p>Nothing is impossible. If you are having trouble going somewhere or doing something, don’t give up. You just haven’t found the best solution or met the right person yet. Don’t listen to those who say it can’t be done. </p>\n<p>Perseverance pays off. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been told what I want isn’t possible, only to prove it wrong later when I don’t listen to the advice and try anyway.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Central-America/Nicaragua/i-jbftbFf/1/900x900/leon-local-girls-900x900.jpg\" title=\"Travel Tip: Smile &amp; Say Hello\" alt=\"My Best Travel Tips\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Travel Tip: Smile &amp; Say Hello</p>\n</div>\n<h2>11. Smile &amp; Say Hello</h2>\n<p>Having trouble interacting with locals? Do people seem unfriendly? Maybe it’s your body language. One of my best travel tips is to make eye contact and smile as you walk by. If they smile back, say hello in the local language too. This is a fast way to make new friends. </p>\n<p>You can’t expect everyone to just walk around with a big stupid grin on their face. That’s your job. Usually all it takes is for you to initiate contact and they’ll open up.</p>\n<h2>12. Splurge A Bit</h2>\n<p>I’m a huge fan of budget travel, as it allows you to travel longer and actually experience more of the fascinating world we live in rather than waste your hard-earned money on stuff you don’t need. In fact you can <a href=\"http://geni.us/ZZn\" target=\"_blank\">travel many places for $50 a day</a> with no problems. </p>\n<p>That said, living on a shoestring gets old after a while. It’s nice (and healthy) to go over your budget occasionally. Book a few days at a nice hotel, eat out at a fancy restaurant, or spend a wild night on the town.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Central-America/Nicaragua/i-6FNdDLz/3/900x900/telica-cock-fighting-ring-900x900.jpg\" title=\"Travel Tip: Keep an Open Mind\" alt=\"My Best Travel Tips\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Travel Tip: Keep an Open Mind</p>\n</div>\n<h2>13. Keep An Open Mind</h2>\n<p>Don’t judge the lifestyles of others if <a href=\"http://expertvagabond.com/central-american-cockfighting/\" target=\"_blank\">different from your own</a>. Listen to opinions you don’t agree with. It’s arrogant to assume your views are correct and other people are wrong. Practice empathy and put yourself in someone else’s shoes. </p>\n<p>Embrace different possibilities, opportunities, people, suggestions and interests. Ask questions. You don’t have to agree, but you may be surprised what you’ll learn. </p>\n<h2>14. Try Couchsurfing</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.couchsurfing.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Couchsurfing.org</a> is a large online community of travelers who share their spare rooms or couches with strangers for free. If you truly want to experience a country and it’s people, staying with a local is the way to go. </p>\n<p>There are millions of couchsurfers around the world willing to host you and provide recommendations. It’s fun and safe too. Expensive hotels are not the only option, there are all kinds of <a href=\"http://expertvagabond.com/cheap-travel-accommodation/\">cheap travel accommodation options</a> out there.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Central-America/Guatemala/i-vzRg4BR/1/900x900/san-pedro-charity-work-900x900.jpg\" title=\"Travel Tip: Volunteer Occasionally\" alt=\"My Best Travel Tips\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Travel Tip: Volunteer Occasionally</p>\n</div>\n<h2>15. Volunteer Occasionally</h2>\n<p>Make it a point to <a href=\"http://expertvagabond.com/build-poop-oven/\">volunteer some of your time</a> for worthwhile projects when traveling. Not only is it a very rewarding experience, but you’ll often learn more about the country and its people while also making new friends. </p>\n<p>There’s a great site called <a href=\"http://grassrootsvolunteering.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Grassroots Volunteering</a> where you can search for highly recommended volunteer opportunities around the world.</p>\n<h2>16. Pack Ear Plugs</h2>\n<p>This should actually be #1 on the list. I love my earplugs! Muffle the sounds of crying babies, drunk Australians, barking dogs, honking horns, dormitory sex, natural gas salesmen, and more. A traveler’s best friend. <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1blKzMy\" target=\"_blank\">These are my favorite earplugs</a> for comfort &amp; effectiveness. </p>\n<p class=\"readnext\">READ MORE: <a href=\"http://expertvagabond.com/travel-gear-guide/\">My Complete Travel Gear Guide</a></p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/North-America/Mexico/Veracruz/i-J5zR28R/1/900x900/veracruz-marine-soldiers-900x900.jpg\" title=\"Travel Tip: Don\'t Be Afraid\" alt=\"My Best Travel Tips\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Travel Tip: Don’t Be Afraid</p>\n</div>\n<h2>17. Don’t Be Afraid</h2>\n<p>The world is not nearly as dangerous as the media makes it out to be. Keep an eye out for sketchy situations but don’t let that be the focus of your whole trip. Use common sense and you’ll be ok. Most people are friendly, trustworthy, generous, and willing to help you out. </p>\n<p>This goes for women too. I realize I’m not a woman, but I’ve met plenty of <a href=\"http://www.ottsworld.com/blogs/going-it-alone/\" target=\"_blank\">experienced</a> <a href=\"http://www.legalnomads.com/2013/02/female-solo-travel.html\" target=\"_blank\">female</a> <a href=\"http://www.bemytravelmuse.com/solo-female-travel/\" target=\"_blank\">travelers</a> who agree.</p>\n<h2>18. Get Lost On Purpose</h2>\n<p>If you want to see the parts of town where real people live &amp; work, you need to go visit them. The best way to do this is on foot — without knowing exactly where you’re going. Write down the name of your hotel so you can catch a taxi back if needed, then just pick a direction and start walking. </p>\n<p>Don’t worry too much about stumbling into dangerous neighborhoods either, as locals will generally warn you before you get that far.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Asia/Thailand/i-wD8cc64/0/900x900/bangkok-khaosan-scorpion-900x900.jpg\" title=\"Travel Tip: Eat Local Food\" alt=\"My Best Travel Tips\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Travel Tip: Eat Local Food</p>\n</div>\n<h2>19. Eat Local Food</h2>\n<p>Think you already know what Mexican food tastes like? <a href=\"http://expertvagabond.com/mexican-food-yucatan/\">You’re probably wrong</a>. Taste a bit of everything when you travel, especially if you don’t know what it is. Ask local people for recommendations. Eat street food from vendors with big lines out front. </p>\n<p>I’ve been very sick only twice in my travels. Don’t be scared of the food.</p>\n<p class=\"readnext\">READ MORE: <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1VjI2lY\" target=\"_blank\">The Food Traveler’s Handbook</a></p>\n<h2>20. Say Yes Often</h2>\n<p>Be impulsive and say yes when someone randomly invites you to meet their family, try a new activity, or explore a place you didn’t know existed. It’s these unexpected and unplanned situations that add spice to your travels and always turn into the best stories later. </p>\n<p>Accept the kindness of strangers when you travel — you’ll have plenty of opportunities.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Central-America/Guatemala/i-DFM4hB3/5/900x900/lake-atitlan-guide-pedro-900x900.jpg\" title=\"Travel Tip: Slow Down\" alt=\"My Best Travel Tips\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Travel Tip: Slow Down</p>\n</div>\n<h2>21. Slow Down</h2>\n<p>Please don’t try to cram 6 countries into 6 weeks of travel. All the good stuff happens when you really take the time to explore. You’ll learn about activities that aren’t in your guidebook and meet people who are eager to show you around. </p>\n<p>I can honestly say that NONE of my <a href=\"http://expertvagabond.com/best/\">best travel experiences</a> happened within the first few days of arriving somewhere. Spend more time in fewer places for maximum enjoyment.</p>\n<h2>22. Keep Good Notes</h2>\n<p>My memory for details sucks. When I first started traveling the world 4 years ago, I didn’t keep a good journal, and now I’m regretting it. Information like the names of people I met, conversations I had, feelings about a new experience, or what a particular town smelled like. </p>\n<p>If you ever want to write about your travels, these details are handy. These days I use an incredible note-taking app called <a href=\"https://expertvagabond.com/go/evernote\" target=\"_blank\">Evernote</a>, which I use as my 2nd brain. So useful for all kinds of applications — from planning trips to journaling about them later.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Asia/Thailand/i-5bbmKCc/3/900x900/sak-yant-traditional-tattoo-900x900.jpg\" title=\"Travel Tip: Break Out of Your Comfort Zone\" alt=\"My Best Travel Tips\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Travel Tip: Break Out of Your Comfort Zone</p>\n</div>\n<h2>23. Break Out Of Your Comfort Zone</h2>\n<p>Challenge yourself to <a href=\"http://expertvagabond.com/sak-yant-tattoo/\">try things that normally give you anxiety</a>. The more you do this, the more that anxiety will fade away. Not a hiker? Go on more hikes. Have trouble talking to strangers? Talk to everyone. Scared of weird food? Eat the weirdest thing you can find. </p>\n<p>The reason this works so well while traveling is because everything is already so different, what’s one more new/uncomfortable experience?</p>\n<h2>24. Don’t Plan Too Much</h2>\n<p>I cringe when readers ask how many days they should spend in a particular country or city. The truth is I have no idea what you’ll enjoy or who you’ll meet. I thought I’d rocket through Nicaragua in a week or two, but ended up living there for 4 months. </p>\n<p>My advice is to pick a starting point, 1 or 2 must-do activities, and an ending point (or not). Then just <a href=\"http://expertvagabond.com/hitchhiking-america/\">let the universe determine the rest</a>.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/photos/i-btp5szr/0/900x900/i-btp5szr-900x900.jpg\" title=\"Travel Tip: Pack Less Stuff\" alt=\"My Best Travel Tips\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Travel Tip: Pack Less Stuff</p>\n</div>\n<h2>25. Pack Less Stuff</h2>\n<p>You don’t need 1/2 the gear you think you do to travel anywhere. We’ve all done it. It’s a right of passage for travelers to slowly become better at packing less. My first backpack was 70 liters packed full, my current bag is only 38 liters. </p>\n<p>As a full-time vagabond, <a href=\"http://expertvagabond.com/travel-gear-guide/\">everything I own fits on my back</a>. If you’re not sure about packing something, you don’t need it. It’s also possible to buy most things at your destination country if you discover you need them.</p>\n<h2>26. Listen To Podcasts</h2>\n<p>Podcasts are awesome. It’s like creating your own personal radio station and filling it with shows and music you always want to listen to. I never thought I’d actually look forward to a 10 hour bus ride. But with podcasts, it’s possible (well, as long as the seats are comfortable). </p>\n<p>Time will fly by as you listen to incredible storytelling, fun music, or interviews with experts. Here are some of my favorites: <a href=\"http://www.thisamericanlife.org/podcast\" target=\"_blank\">This American Life</a>, <a href=\"http://themoth.org/about/programs/the-moth-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">The Moth</a>, <a href=\"http://risk-show.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RISK!</a>, <a href=\"http://www.radiolab.org/series/podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\">Radiolab</a>, <a href=\"http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/category/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\">Smart Passive Income</a>, and <a href=\"http://electro-swing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Electro-Swing</a>.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/North-America/Mexico/Chihuahua/i-svtVPbm/1/900x900/tarahumara-running-matt-900x900.jpg\" title=\"Travel Tip: Exercise More\" alt=\"My Best Travel Tips\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Travel Tip: Treat Your Body Well</p>\n</div>\n<h2>27. Treat Your Body Well</h2>\n<p>Travel can throw your body out of whack. When you’re moving from place to place it’s difficult to maintain a workout routine, and many of us slack off. Or we don’t sleep enough. Or we <a href=\"http://www.everywhereist.com/new-york-cupcakes-a-descent-into-madness/\" target=\"_blank\">eat too many cupcakes</a>. I’m guilty of not flossing my teeth. </p>\n<p>Remember to be nice to your body. Get enough sleep, stay hydrated, eat healthy, use sunscreen, and exercise often (<a href=\"http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2009/12/09/beginner-body-weight-workout-burn-fat-build-muscle/\" target=\"_blank\">check out this bodyweight routine</a>, no gym required!). And, yes, flossing too I guess.</p>\n<h2>28. Stay In Touch</h2>\n<p>Remember to call your family &amp; friends from time to time. Maybe surprise them and go old-school by sending a postcard (it’s in the mail, Mom!). Travel isn’t lonely, far from it. You constantly meet other people. But many of those relationships are fleeting. So maintaining a strong connection with the people who know you best is important.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Central-America/Panama/i-j8R3GB4/8/900x900/darien-river-piragua-900x900.jpg\" title=\"Travel Tip: Get Off the Beaten Path\" alt=\"My Best Travel Tips\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Travel Tip: Get Off the Beaten Path</p>\n</div>\n<h2>29. Get Off The Beaten Path</h2>\n<p>I know it’s cliché, but you should still attempt it. Seek out <a href=\"http://expertvagabond.com/hiking-darien-national-park/\">interesting and unusual places</a> that don’t see much tourism. Many memorable travel experiences have happened to me in areas that are not easy to visit. By all means travel to popular sites, but don’t rule out other locations just because they’re not on the tourist trail. </p>\n<p>Although please realize that just because an area is remote or dangerous doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll have a life-changing experience.</p>\n<h2>30. Travel More</h2>\n<p>If there’s one thing I’ve noticed over the past 4 years, it’s that many people back home love to tell me how lucky I am while making excuses why they can’t travel. It’s too expensive. They can’t get time off work. </p>\n<p><em>Who will feed their pets?</em> </p>\n<p>When I suggest solutions to these “problems”, they still don’t take action. Why? Because they’re often hiding behind the true reason: they’re scared. </p>\n<p><strong>Unfortunately most people who wait to travel the world never do.</strong> </p>\n<p>You don’t need to sell all your worldly possessions and become a homeless vagabond like me. Just get out there more than you do now. Start with a weekend in a different state. Then maybe try a week in the country next door. </p>\n<p>The new car, remodeling project, and iPhone can wait. If you truly want to travel more, you can make it happen. Career breaks are possible. You have friends who would love to watch your pets. </p>\n<p>It’s a big, beautiful, exciting, and fascinating world out there. </p>\n<p><em>Explore some of it now, rather than later.</em> ★</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Central-America/Panama/i-r7qkDgS/3/900x900/darien-gap-wounaan-children-900x900.jpg\" title=\"How to Travel the World\" alt=\"Travel More\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">How to Travel the World</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Travel The World</h2>\n<p>Want to know how to travel the world?

Sounds insane, right? That’s what I thought too. Turns out sharks aren’t the terrifying monsters we think they are.</span></p>\n<p>For millions of years sharks have slowly evolved into nature’s most deadly assassins. Lethal eating machines with razor sharp teeth, lightning-quick speed, and an unquenchable thirst for human blood!</p>\n<p><strong>(Ok, I made that last part up.)</strong></p>\n<p>But we’ve all seen the movie <em>“Jaws”</em> — and Hollywood doesn’t lie. It’s why thousands of people around the world suffer from <em>Selachophobia</em>. Fear of sharks. </p>\n<p>But who can blame them? Why on earth would any rational person swim in the ocean not knowing what man-eating creatures may lurk beneath the waves? </p>\n<p>As for those who purposefully seek out the company of sharks — they clearly have a death wish.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Oceania/Fiji/i-7HH6rqc/1/900x900/beqa-reef-diving-900x900.jpg\" title=\"Tropical Fish Beqa Fiji\" alt=\"Tropical Fish Beqa Fiji\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fiji’s Magical Underwater World</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Seeking The Company Of Sharks</h2>\n<p>As an adrenaline junkie, my tolerance level these days is high. Luckily Fiji delivered the goods. They have a <a href=\"http://www.fijisharkdive.com/conservation/shark-reef-marine-reserve\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shark Reef Marine Reserve</a> located off the coast of the island of Beqa, where you can go swimming with up to 8 species of shark.</p>\n<p>To help finance shark research and compensate local villagers for their lost fishing grounds, <a href=\"http://fijisharkdive.com/\" title=\"Shark Diving Fiji\" target=\"_blank\">Beqa Adventure Divers</a> offers scuba diving trips into the marine reserve’s shark-infested waters. </p>\n<p><strong>They let you get face-to-face with these underwater killers.</strong> </p>\n<p><em>Killers of fish that is.</em> </p>\n<p>Because shark attacks on humans around the world are exceedingly rare — despite popular belief to the contrary.</p>\n<h2>Shark Attack Odds</h2>\n<p>Let’s look at some examples. How likely is a shark attack in the United States? Odds are greater that one of these will happen to you first:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will die from a dog attack.</li>\n<li>You will die from a lightning strike.</li>\n<li>You will get killed by bees or wasps.</li>\n<li>You will be executed for a crime.</li>\n<li>You will be bitten by a human.</li>\n<li>You will die falling down in your home.</li>\n<li>Dick Cheney will shoot you on a hunting trip.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As for <em>actual death</em> by shark attack, that’s even rarer. Like <a href=\"http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/attacks/relarisklifetime.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">1 in 3,748,067</a> to be exact. <strong>You are <a href=\"http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/attacks/relarisksand.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">more likely</a> to die while digging a sand hole on the beach.</strong> </p>\n<p>So stop digging those stupid things. They’re dangerous!</p>\n<p></p><center>\n<div style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Oceania/Fiji/i-9rZxswz/1/700x700/shark-diving-matt-700x700.jpg\" title=\"Scuba Diving with Sharks Fiji\" alt=\"Scuba Diving with Sharks Fiji\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cue Music from <em>“Jaws”</em></p>\n</div>\n<p></p></center><p></p>\n<h2>My First Shark Dive</h2>\n<p>Knowing these statistics made it a bit easier to join the professionals at Beqa Adventure for my first ever shark dive. They’ve been doing this for over 10 years with no problems. </p>\n<p>I’ve been <a href=\"http://expertvagabond.com/dos-ojos-cenote-dive/\" title=\"Cenote Diving Mexico\">scuba diving in caves</a> before, but diving with large Bull and possibly Tiger sharks was a big deal. These massive animals can grow 8 to 15 feet long and weigh hundreds of pounds. </p>\n<p>Both have a history (however rare) of attacks on humans. </p>\n<p><strong>I’d be lying if I told you I wasn’t nervous to dive with them.</strong></p>\n<p>But, as I’ve learned over &amp; over again on my travels, breaking out of your comfort zone is a healthy thing to do. So down I went down below to meet these toothy phobia-inducing creatures in person.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Oceania/Fiji/i-LDcbhhk/1/900x900/shark-diving-beqa-900x900.jpg\" title=\"Grey Reef Shark Beqa Fiji\" alt=\"Grey Reef Shark Beqa Fiji\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Grey Reef Shark Posing for the Camera</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Shark Diving Fiji</h2>\n<p>It was time to suit up and hop off the boat for a 100 foot descent into the ocean. Once at the bottom, local Fijian dive masters positioned us on top of a coral wall, looking down into a sandy pit. Then the feeding began. There was no turning back now!</p>\n<p>Two divers pull fish parts from plastic containers attracting a gigantic whirling mass of Jacks, Snappers, and other reef fish. It wasn’t long before the sharks appeared to get in on the action. First it was Nurses, Black Tips, and Grey Reef sharks. At 4 to 6 feet long, they were impressive enough. </p>\n<p><strong>But then came the Bulls. Ten foot 400 pounders with menacing teeth.</strong></p>\n<p>Most of the big guys kept their distance from us, but just watching their huge forms maneuver through the water was an awe-inspiring sight.</p>\n<p>After about 17 minutes of sharky fun, we ascended to a depth of 30 feet to continue the spectacle of motion. Black Tips, White Tips, Grey Reefs, and Nurses swam just a foot or two away from my face among hundreds of colorful red, blue, and yellow reef fish.</p>\n<p>Our dive masters used aluminum poles to keep some overly excited sharks from getting too close.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"http://travelphotos.expertvagabond.com/Oceania/Fiji/i-r6SXSw8/1/900x900/bull-shark-900x900.jpg\" title=\"Bull Shark Beqa Fiji\" alt=\"Bull Shark Beqa Fiji\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bull Shark Investigates Us (Credit: Mike Purcell)</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Shark Feeding Controversy</h2>\n<p>Now if you didn’t already know, feeding sharks like this is a bit controversial. Some say that it trains them to associate humans with food, increasing the odds of an attack. Yet there is zero hard proof of this yet. It’s only speculation.</p>\n<p>These diving trips pour much needed money into shark conservation &amp; research projects. Without that money, shark populations around the world will continue to rapidly decline. If dive operators don’t pay to help save the sharks, who will? You? The government?</p>\n<p><strong>That’s wishful thinking in my opinion. It won’t happen.</strong></p>\n<p>The ONLY reason marine life is protected at Fiji’s Shark Reserve is because of the money flowing in from these dive trips. Beqa Adventure Divers teamed up with local villages to ban all fishing here in 2004. The result? A once dying reef is thriving and full of life again. </p>\n<p>After over 10 years of feeding sharks here, attacks in Fiji are still just as rare as anywhere else. <a href=\"http://sharkattackfile.info/shark-attack-search-simple-2/search-date-coutry-of-attacking-sharks.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Averaging 1-2 a year</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>It’s important to keep in mind that swimming with sharks is probably a bit more dangerous than watching them on the Discovery Channel.</strong></p>\n<p>But don’t fall for all the media sensationalism. Math doesn’t lie. The odds are in your favor.

The true story of two medical students embarking on a five month motorcycle trip across South America in order to use their medical training to volunteer for a remote leper colony along the Amazon river. Based on the personal journals of latin American revolutionary Che Guevara, it highlights the freedom, adventure, and personal discovery that is part of the travel experience.

You get to experience both the ups and downs of his trip at a very personal level. If you ever thought of doing something like this, the movie will show you what the experience is really like.

In fact, Viñales is rumored to be Fidel Castro’s favorite part of Cuba!</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Caribbean/Cuba/i-5vjfQNB/0/XL/vinales-horse-matt-XL.jpg\" title=\"Horseback Riding Through Tobacco Farms\" alt=\"Horseback Riding Vinales Cuba\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Horseback Riding Through Tobacco Farms</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Caribbean/Cuba/i-tbX2Rn5/0/XL/vinales-cigars-XL.jpg\" title=\"Best Cigars in the World?\" alt=\"Vinales Cigars\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Best Cigars in the World?</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Viñales National Park</h2>\n<p>Viñales Valley was named a <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/840\" target=\"_blank\">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a> in 1999 due to its dramatic landscape of karst limestone domes called <em>mogotes</em>, traditional agricultural methods of farming, and rich cultural history.</p>\n<p>The valley was formed underwater, rising from the sea millions of years ago. Ancient ocean fossils can still be found in the caves that dot the landscape.</p>\n<p>The New York Times called Viñales one of the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/07/travel/places-to-visit.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">top places to visit in 2016</a>.</p>\n<p>But aside from being a beautiful travel destination, Viñales is known for the quality of its tobacco. I’m not a “smoker” per se, but I do enjoy the occasional cigar at the end of a big trek or for special occasions.</p>\n<p>So I was excited to learn how Cuba’s world-famous cigars are actually made.  </p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Caribbean/Cuba/i-tNRMzZx/0/XL/vinales-tobacco-farmer-XL.jpg\" title=\"Harvesting Tobacco Leaves\" alt=\"Tobacco Farm Cuba\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Harvesting Tobacco Leaves</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Caribbean/Cuba/i-H647rw9/0/XL/vinales-pig-snout-XL.jpg\" title=\"Friendly Livestock!\" alt=\"Vinales Livestock\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Friendly Livestock!</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Home Of Cuban Cigars</h2>\n<p>Why are Cuban cigars so special? Well, many people believe Cuba is the birthplace of cigars. Christopher Columbus encountered native Cubans smoking cylindrical bundles of twisted tobacco leaves in 1492.</p>\n<p>The practice was eventually exported to Europe, and by the 19th century, smoking cigars became a popular pastime for wealthy men — who formed special cigar clubs called <em>divans</em>.</p>\n<p>Cuba’s time-honored tobacco growing and production techniques were exported to places like the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua. Then came the United States trade embargo, making Cuban cigars illegal — and increasing their value even more.</p>\n<p>The fertile land and favorable climate of Viñales make for perfect cigar tobacco growing conditions. Most residents here are in the tobacco farming business.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Caribbean/Cuba/i-kgv3XJZ/0/XL/vinales-farm-house-XL.jpg\" title=\"Pastel Colored Farmhouse\" alt=\"Farmhouse in Vinales\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pastel Colored Farmhouse</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Caribbean/Cuba/i-btdJpNJ/0/XL/vinales-guide-papito-XL.jpg\" title=\"Our Farm Guide \" papito\"\"=\"\" alt=\"Vinales Tobacco Farm Tour\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Our Horse Guide “Papito”</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Tobacco Farm Experience</h2>\n<p>We hired a guide and some horses to take a tour of Viñales National Park, learning about the traditional techniques used here for hundreds of years. No machines are used, which means crops are picked by hand and fields are plowed with oxen.</p>\n<p>Passing through farms with pigs, chickens, and turkeys, we rode along green tobacco fields where local workers were harvesting the last of the season’s prized leaves. Tobacco grows fast, ready for harvest after 2-3 months.</p>\n<p>The leaves are then hung in special curing barns, where they dry for about a month, turning a toasty brown color. The Cuban government buys 90% of the tobacco, while locals are allowed to keep 10% for themselves.</p>\n<p>To prepare Cuban cigars, the center vein of the leaf is removed, where 98% of the nicotine resides. Next, leaves are sprayed with a special mixture of ingredients like pineapple, lemon, honey, cinnamon, vanilla, and rum for the fermentation process.</p>\n<p>Three different types of leaves are used to roll the final cigar — filler (inside), binder (holding it together), and the wrapper (visually appealing outer layer).</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Caribbean/Cuba/i-SvVhfJ4/0/XL/vinales-tobacco-barn-XL.jpg\" title=\"Tobacco Drying Barn\" alt=\"Tobacco Barn Cuba\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tobacco Drying Barn</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Caribbean/Cuba/i-VvWzZ5L/0/XL/vinales-farmers-XL.jpg\" title=\"Cuban Cowboys\" alt=\"Vinales Cuba Cowboys\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cuban Cowboys</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Adventures In Viñales</h2>\n<p>Visiting tobacco farms isn’t the only thing to do in Viñales though. As part of the farm tour, we also explored one of the many limestone caves in the area. Rock climbing these unique limestone formations is a popular activity too. </p>\n<p>Aside from guided horseback riding, you can also rent a bicycle, ATV, or motorcycle and explore the valley on your own. There’s a popular cave called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KquE8yxwVwg\" target=\"_blank\">Cueva del Indio</a> where you can ride a boat on the underground river that flows through the cave.</p>\n<p>We heard stories about a nice little beach about an hour North of Viñales called <a href=\"https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1572264-d4108049-r196200614-Cayo_Jutias-Minas_de_Matahambre_Pinar_del_Rio_Province_Cuba.html\" target=\"_blank\">Cayo Jutías</a>, but didn’t have time to visit.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 910px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img src=\"https://photos.smugmug.com/Caribbean/Cuba/i-rMNh9Nq/0/XL/vinales-oxen-XL.jpg\" title=\"Ox Cart Animal Power\" alt=\"Vinales Ox Cart\">\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ox Cart Animal Power</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Tips For Visiting</h2>\n<p>Viñales is located about 3-4 hours West of Havana. There are regular <a href=\"http://www.viazul.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Viazul Busses</a> that run twice a day for about $15 USD per person. But you often need to buy your ticket a day in advance. </p>\n<p>Or you can do what we did, and rent a vintage taxi with room for 4 people for about $60-$70 depending on your bargaining skills.</p>\n<p>While walking the outskirts of Viñales, you might be waved over to learn about the cigar making process at some random farm. It’s a fun experience, just understand that at the end your host will ask you to buy a bundle of 15-20 cigars for about $1 each. </p>\n<p>Cuban cigars can cost $10-$20 each in the USA… so it’s a pretty good deal!</p>\n<p><em>“If I cannot smoke in heaven, then I shall not go.”</em> <strong>~ Mark Twain</strong> ★</p>\n<h3><font color=\"red\">Watch Video:</font> Viñales Farm Adventure</h3>\n<div class=\"videoContainer\"><iframe width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/M8ZAJ_IXAfg?controls=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;VQ=HD720\"></iframe></div>\n<p><script src=\"https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js\" gapi_processed=\"true\"></script></p>\n<div id=\"___ytsubscribe_0\" style=\"text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; background-color: transparent; border-style: none; float: none; line-height: normal; font-size: 1px; vertical-align: baseline; display: inline-block; width: 170px; height: 48px; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"position: static; top: 0px; width: 170px; margin: 0px; border-style: none; left: 0px; visibility: visible; height: 48px;\" tabindex=\"0\" vspace=\"0\" width=\"100%\" id=\"I0_1465714673923\" name=\"I0_1465714673923\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/subscribe_embed?usegapi=1&amp;channel=ExpertVagabond&amp;layout=full&amp;count=default&amp;origin=http%3A%2F%2Fexpertvagabond.com&amp;gsrc=3p&amp;ic=1&amp;jsh=m%3B%2F_%2Fscs%2Fapps-static%2F_%2Fjs%2Fk%3Doz.gapi.nl.YGPwWyUiFxk.O%2Fm%3D__features__%2Fam%3DEQ%2Frt%3Dj%2Fd%3D1%2Frs%3DAGLTcCNgYNcB4y5irva3OljWgRCX2RTsuQ#_methods=onPlusOne%2C_ready%2C_close%2C_open%2C_resizeMe%2C_renderstart%2Concircled%2Cdrefresh%2Cerefresh%2Conload&amp;id=I0_1465714673923&amp;parent=http%3A%2F%2Fexpertvagabond.com&amp;pfname=&amp;rpctoken=39431188\" data-gapiattached=\"true\"></iframe></div>\n<p><span class=\"small\">(Click to watch <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8ZAJ_IXAfg\" target=\"_blank\">Viñales Farm Adventure – Cuba </a> on YouTube)</span></p>\n<div id=\"moreinformation\">\n<h4>More Information</h4>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> Viñales, Cuba [<a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/M7Q7MNddGyB2\" target=\"_blank\">Map</a>]<br>\n<strong>Accommodation:</strong> Casa Lay (email: layvinales@nauta.cu)<br>\n<strong>Horseback Farm Tour:</strong> 35 CUC ($35 USD)<br>\n<strong>Useful Notes:</strong> Our tobacco farm tour was done on horseback, but they also have ox carts or bikes available.

And if it’s totally cute and colorful, it tastes even better, right?! That’s certainly the case with these tie dye popsicles. Obviously they’re gorgeous and just scream, “I’m healthy and full of antioxidants,” but they also taste absolutely incredible!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Believe it or not, nailing health, beauty and taste in a recipe can be hard. Sometimes we sacrifice taste because something is “good for us,” or it’s gorgeous for a photo but might not be the healthiest choice. I’m here to say, these get an A+ on ERRTHANG!!!!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Oh! And did I mention they’re easy to make? I’ll teach you the trick to layering if you don’t have the patience to freeze every layer before adding the next one. (I mean, who has time for that?) We need to get to the sweet, sour, cold and perfectly drippy final product instead of laboring for hours. Imagine all the possibilities for colors too! Just select the colors of fruit you wish to highlight for your next soiree, and follow the method for these no-fail pops! Seriously guys, you must make these with your favorite fruits! They taste way better than anything you can get from a store, and there’s no added sugar, so you can feel good about eating them. They’re also less than 100 calories each!<a href=\"http://www.blogilates.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/square.jpg\"><br>\n</a> <a href=\"http://www.blogilates.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/square-ice.jpg\"><br>\n</a> <a href=\"http://www.blogilates.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/single-pop.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22770\" src=\"http://www.blogilates.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/single-pop.jpg\" alt=\"single pop\" width=\"580\" height=\"773\"></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>TIE DYE POPSICLES</u></strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Yield: 1 serving</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Serving Size: 1 popsicle</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Prep Time: 15 min</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Chill Time:&nbsp;4-6 hrs</p>\n<p><strong><u>Ingredients:</u></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Green Layer</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>1/2 cup packed spinach</li>\n<li>4 kiwi, peeled</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons lime juice</li>\n<li>Pinch of stevia, or 6 drops liquid stevia</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Orange Layer</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>4-5 frozen peach slices (about 1 peeled peach), slightly thawed</li>\n<li>1/2 cup frozen mango chunks, slightly thawed</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons orange juice</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Yellow Layer</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>3/4 cup frozen pineapple tidbits</li>\n<li>1/2 ripe (unfrozen) banana</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons orange juice</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Purple Layer</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>1/2 cup blackberries</li>\n<li>1/4 cup frozen blueberries</li>\n<li>1/4 banana</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pink Layer</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>1/2 cup pomegranate seeds</li>\n<li>1/4 banana</li>\n<li>2 tablespoons orange juice</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22772\" src=\"http://www.blogilates.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/square.jpg\" alt=\"square\" width=\"650\" height=\"650\"></p>\n<p><strong><u>Method</u></strong><strong>:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Prepare 8 popsicle <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1WxAf9x\" target=\"_blank\">molds like these</a>&nbsp;into their holders.</li>\n<li>Begin by blending the green layer ingredients until completely smooth.

Shredded abs, poppin’ biceps, and a huge, lifted booty. At least that is what Instagram tells us.&nbsp;And I don’t doubt that people with those physiques are lean and fit, but you shouldn’t feel weaker if you don’t look that way. Strength is something from inside, and no one can accurately judge you for that. We all have our own story.</p>\n<p>I used to live a life where I strived for vanity in my physique. I mean, I competed in a bikini competition – how much more physically obsessed&nbsp;can you get!? I worked my head off 4 hours a day to lose weight and have slightly more visible abs than I do in the pic above, where I work out only 28 minutes a day with <strong><a href=\"http://www.piit28.com\">PIIT28</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>But now, the difference is, I work out because it makes me a better person, not because it makes me a “hotter” person.</p>\n<p>I challenge you to think about that for a second.</p>\n<p>Working out makes me stronger, sharper, faster, smarter, less stressed, and happier. The reason why I don’t skip a workout now isn’t because I’m scared of getting fat (old thinking), it’s because I really like the person I am after I exercise. The positive vibes spread to the people I interact with at work and it feeds into my creativity for my business.</p>\n<p>This is what I call a mind shift.&nbsp;And what&nbsp;happened after that mind shift is magical.</p>\n<p>My body started changing.</p>\n<p>It started sculpting itself towards it’s own best shape because I approached fitness with joy, not with angst. I work out for the RIGHT REASONS.</p>\n<p>Now,&nbsp;when I exercise, I get EXCITED (like super excited) when I can go lower in my tricep pushups and when I can sprint faster on the treadmill. There’s this feeling of ultimate inner satisfaction that reminds me of pure childhood joy. I mean,&nbsp;whether or not the scale goes down, and whether or not the muscle striations on my legs become more visible, WHO CARES!!! I don’t need an IG pic and loads of comments saying “You look pretty” to validate my worth! I KNOW MY WORTH!! Look what I can do that I couldn’t do just a few weeks ago!! That is called real strength, and THAT is awesome!</p>\n<p>And guess what? When you focus on what matters, like how much you&nbsp;honestly ENJOY&nbsp;sweating it out, everything just starts to fall in place. You find your balance.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, people try to complicate fitness too much with exact calorie counts, exact calorie burn, and all sorts of crazy wild theories on what you should eat and how you should work out. Do not be overwhelmed with OVER-INFORMATION.</p>\n<p>This is the key:</p>\n<p><strong>Find a workout that makes you smile and keeps you coming back.</strong> It should be something you look forward to, not dread!&nbsp;Then, do it as much as you can (try 5-6 times a week).</p>\n<p><strong>Feed your body for energy.</strong> Notice how your body reacts to certain foods. If you break out or feel lethargic after eating a certain thing, stop having it! Be your own nutritionist. You just have to be conscious.</p>\n<p>That is how you will find your own strong. Strong looks different on EVERYONE. So stop comparing yourself to others. Start comparing yourself to who you were yesterday.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Ready to hear who the <a href=\"http://www.popflexactive.com\">POPFLEX </a>Mermaids Giveaway Winner is?

Are you guys ready for this one? It incorporates two&nbsp;of my favorite, full-body movements&nbsp;(<strong>Man Makers&nbsp;+ running</strong>) for a seriously high-intensity and challenging workout. It’s a “good” one for sure!</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-102550\" src=\"http://carrotsncake.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/10-to-1-Man-Maker-Running-Workout.jpg\" alt=\"10 to 1 Man Maker + Running Workout\" width=\"611\" height=\"855\"></p>\n<p><strong>How to do this workout</strong>: Perform 10 Man Makers and then run 400 meters. After that, you’ll do 9 Man Makers followed by a 400 meter run. Then, 8 Man Makers, 400 meter run, 7 Man Makers, 400 meter run… all the way down to 1 Man Maker with a final 400 meter run. You’ll run a total of 2.5 miles during this workout, but you can always reduce the running to 200 meters. It’ll still be an awesome&nbsp;workout!</p>\n<p>Ok, so you’ve never done a Man Maker before? You’re in for a treat!!&nbsp;Start with two dumbbells, one in each hand, in the top of a push-up position. Do a push-up and then perform a row, right arm and then left arm, with the dumbbells.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://carrotsncake.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cnc-2648.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image:

alt=\"cnc-2648\" width=\"604\" height=\"404\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p>Then, jump your feet in and perform a Squat Clean to Thruster with the dumbbells.</p>\n<p><a

the Thruster, you’ve completed one&nbsp;rep.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://carrotsncake.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cnc-2663.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left:

This way of training&nbsp;torches some serious calories&nbsp;<em>and</em> the&nbsp;short, fast&nbsp;intervals can even help you become a better&nbsp;runner. Awesome.

And many <strong>thanks</strong> to the veterans who have served our country.</p>\n<p>We had a nice long weekend over here. It was a mix of emotions at times, so I figured a <a href=\"http://carrotsncake.com/tag/high-low-high\">High Low High</a> post was the perfect way to recap it.&nbsp;If you’re unfamiliar with this series, I recap the <strong>high</strong> and <strong>low</strong> points of the weekend. It’s fun. Ok, here we go!</p>\n<p><strong>HIGH</strong>: Starting&nbsp;the weekend with a tough&nbsp;Saturday morning&nbsp;<a href=\"http://saltshackcrossfit.com/salt-shack-crossfit-hanover-wod/\">partner workout</a>&nbsp;at CrossFit&nbsp;(fyi – reps were increased to 60 for all exercises), which included me doing 12 HSPUs. Whoa. Five of them were even linked. Hey now. Progress!</p>\n<p><strong>LOW</strong>: Stopping by <a href=\"http://www.cvs.com/\">CVS/pharmacy</a> after CrossFit to pick up a prescription for Budesonide/Entocort since Entyvio isn’t really working for me. Ugghhh. My doctor assures me there’s still a chance that it might (some patients need 3-4 “maintenance” doses for it really to kick in), but I’m starting to lose hope.&nbsp;Budesonide will hopefully get me through the next few months. (It’s a steroid, so I’m on a 3-month taper). *sigh*</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://carrotsncake.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_7744-1280x1280.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"IMG_7744 (1280x1280)\" src=\"http://carrotsncake.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_7744-1280x1280_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_7744 (1280x1280)\" width=\"604\" height=\"604\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>HIGH</strong>: Having an amazing time and celebrating our&nbsp;friends at their wedding in Meredith, New Hampshire! So fun!! Jen and Jon are&nbsp;such an awesome couple and it was so nice to spend time&nbsp;with them and the rest of our hometown friends. Annnnnnd Mal and I stayed overnight, kid-free. Yayyy!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://carrotsncake.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-05-30-PHOTO-00000392-960x1280.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"2016-05-30-PHOTO-00000392 (960x1280)\" src=\"http://carrotsncake.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2016-05-30-PHOTO-00000392-960x1280_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"2016-05-30-PHOTO-00000392 (960x1280)\" width=\"604\" height=\"804\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>LOW</strong>:&nbsp;In two years,&nbsp;it was the first time we had an overnight without Q-man. Obviously, we love our little guy, but we really need more adult-only overnight trips in our life!</p>\n<p><strong>HIGH</strong>: Trying <a href=\"http://www.lilawines.com/\">Lila Wines</a> Sauvignon Blanc (aka wine in a can). It was actually really tasty and so convenient! I will definitely keep it in mind for trips to the beach this summer. FYI: My dress is from <a href=\"http://rstyle.me/n/brdfdnb5itf\">Banana Republic</a>, but I bought it 5+ years ago.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://carrotsncake.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_7698-1280x1280.jpg\"><img style=\"background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;\" title=\"IMG_7698 (1280x1280)\" src=\"http://carrotsncake.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_7698-1280x1280_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_7698 (1280x1280)\" width=\"604\" height=\"604\" border=\"0\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>LOW</strong>: Not trying the other flavors of Lila.

How you answer this “outlook on life” question may also reflect the attitude you have toward yourself. According to the Mayo Clinic, whether you are typically optimistic or pessimistic may even affect your health. Here is more information about how the power of positive thinking.<br>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12043\" src=\"http://www.comebackmomma.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2016-06-07-at-12.22.25-PM.png\" alt=\"The power of positive thinking for fitness\" width=\"874\" height=\"721\" srcset=\"http://www.comebackmomma.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2016-06-07-at-12.22.25-PM.png 874w, http://www.comebackmomma.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2016-06-07-at-12.22.25-PM-300x247.png 300w, http://www.comebackmomma.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2016-06-07-at-12.22.25-PM-768x634.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px\"></p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555;\">Often, the biggest challenge when it comes to getting fit and healthy is our mindset. Positive thinking is key to reaching your optimal performance and fitness level. Keeping these benefits in mind may help you see the brighter side of life more often.</p>\n<h3>Health benefits that positive thinking may provide include:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased life span</li>\n<li>Lower rates of depression</li>\n<li>Greater resistance to illness</li>\n<li>Better psychological and physical well-being</li>\n<li>Reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease</li>\n<li>Better coping skills during hardships and times of stress</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"color: #555555;\">If you are a natural pessimist, what can you do? You can train your brain to think yourself fit. Here are some simple steps to follow:</p>\n<h3 class=\"nospace\" style=\"color: #555555;\">Picture Success</h3>\n<p class=\"nospace\" style=\"color: #555555;\">Picture the outcome that you want to achieve. Whether you are training to lose a few pounds or <a href=\"http://www.comebackmomma.com/top-5-benefits-running/\">run a 5K</a>, creating a mental picture for success is what will get your to your goal.</p>\n<p class=\"nospace\" style=\"color: #555555;\">Help your brain to focus on what success looks like. It’s like a dress rehearsal for your goals. The more you practice, the more your mind will believe it to be true.&nbsp;Try to make your thoughts about success as clear as possible. Imagine every step of the way. This is a great way to prep for the pressure that may come when taking on a new challenge.</p>\n<h3 class=\"nospace\" style=\"color: #555555;\">Think Small</h3>\n<p class=\"nospace\" style=\"color: #555555;\">Setting a huge goal can set you up to fail. Take training for a marathon as an example. This is a huge task. One that can be overwhelming if you think about it in its entirety. If you break it down into more <a href=\"http://www.comebackmomma.com/tips-fitness-routine/\">manageable goals</a>, the finish line becomes more attainable. When out for a run, you might picture a landmark that you want to reach as your next goal. Once you reach that spot, picture the next landmark you want to reach and so on.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555;\">Like a marathon, completely changing what you eat may seem impossible. Little changes can make a big difference. For example, eat a piece of fruit each day instead of a bag of chips. Swapping out a few items is much easier than trying to take it all on at once.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #555555;\">Over time, small changes will come to equal progress in your quest to eat healthier. According to a study conducted at&nbsp;Northwestern University, small changes can result in a domino effect on other health-related habits.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"color: #555555;\">Researchers set out to alter four unhealthy behaviors: eating too much saturated fat, not eating enough fruits and vegetables, spending too much time being sedentary, and not getting adequate exercise. But, instead of trying to tackle four problems at once, researchers found that a small reduction in TV time, along with eating more fruits and vegetables lead to a healthier lifestyle overall. In all, small changes have a ripple effect that extends into other aspects of your life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"color: #555555;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12040\" src=\"http://www.comebackmomma.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2016-06-07-at-11.48.01-AM-1.png\" alt=\"The power of positive thinking for fitness\" width=\"860\" height=\"479\" srcset=\"http://www.comebackmomma.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2016-06-07-at-11.48.01-AM-1.png 860w, http://www.comebackmomma.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2016-06-07-at-11.48.01-AM-1-300x167.png 300w, http://www.comebackmomma.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2016-06-07-at-11.48.01-AM-1-768x428.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px\"></p>\n<h3 class=\"nospace\" style=\"color: #555555;\">Meditate</h3>\n<p class=\"nospace\" style=\"color: #555555;\">Meditation has long been practiced in other countries. Scientists are looking into the power of meditation in our fast-paced lives. Medication can be a key element in achieving our goals. I love to picture myself in a beautiful place like in the photo above. Taking my mind to someplace quiet and peaceful helps me stay calm and focused. Here is a great article about <strong><a href=\"http://zenhabits.net/meditation-guide/\" onclick=\"__gaTracker(\'send\', \'event\', \'outbound-article\', \'http://zenhabits.net/meditation-guide/\', \'meditation for beginners\');\">meditation for beginners</a>.</strong></p>\n<h3>Focusing on positive thinking</h3>\n<p>You can learn to turn negative thinking into positive thinking. It takes practice, but it’s well worth the effort.&nbsp;Here are some ways to think in a more positive way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Identify areas to change.</strong>&nbsp;Identify areas of your life that you typically have negative thoughts. Is it at&nbsp;work or perhaps a relationship? Start small and focus on one area to approach in a more positive way.</li>\n<li><strong>Check yourself.</strong>&nbsp;Throughout the&nbsp;day, stop and evaluate what you’re thinking. If you notice that your thoughts have been negative, try to find a way to focus on something positive.</li>\n<li><strong>Be open to humor.</strong>&nbsp;When I am having a bad day, I’ll find a good joke on the internet or listen to a comedy channel on the radio.&nbsp;Laughter helps lighten the mood and minimize feelings of stress and negativity.</li>\n<li><strong>Surround yourself with positive people.</strong>&nbsp;Negative people may increase your stress level and make you doubt yourself.

	(73,'\n\n				<p><strong>Call it comfort in a can.</strong> Spam remains a staple in Hawaiian fare, resting&nbsp;atop blocks of rice and wrapped in nori,&nbsp;diced&nbsp;and sprinkled into steaming bowls of saimin, and wedged between grilled pineapple slices and hamburger buns. You can almost hear the ukuleles strum as you take a bite into the apocalypse-friendly&nbsp;meat mashup.</p>\n<p>While today, Spam is associated with&nbsp;gluttony (hey there, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/deep-fried-spam-filled-doughnuts-smashing-success/story?id=24054679\">deep-fried Spam doughnuts!</a>), its island history is rooted in scarcity. In Reddit’s Hawaii community, a redditor who goes by&nbsp;KaiKalFar464952 shared memories of the World War II era, when&nbsp;the product greased its way into cultural consciousness. The firsthand description of the times is eye-opening.</p>\n<p>During the war, troops swarmed&nbsp;through Honolulu on their way to battles in the Pacific. “The military build up on Oahu was stifling,” writesKaiKalFar464952, who was in grade school at the time. “There were over a million servicemen there and they had to be fed so that just about all available foods produced in Hawaii went to them. The locals had to make do by their own wits, hence garden plots everywhere there was a patch of vacant land.” <a href=\"http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe40s/crops_02.html\">Gardening in the name of patriotism was a thing</a>.</p>\n<p>So they figured out how to get fruits and vegetables, but still <a href=\"https://nyamcenterforhistory.org/2015/10/13/the-diaspora-of-spam/\">lacked a&nbsp;reliable&nbsp;supply of locally available protein</a>.&nbsp;That’s where Mr. Hormel stepped&nbsp;in.</p>\n<p>KaiKalFar464952 writes,&nbsp;“I remember the long lines we stood in from before daybreak in order to buy a pound of rice; of the lack of meats of any kind that resulted in people keeping chicken coops in their yards for the eggs and meat; of Spam being the only readily available ‘meat’ in the stores; of people doing a lot of fishing and crabbing to supplement their protein intake etc. Because Spam was our only available ‘meat’, people got creative and concocted a lot of different ways to prepare the stuff to disguise the fact we were still eating Spam every damn day. Humorous to think about now but not so much then.”</p>\n<p>Resourceful Hawaiians did a damn good job inventing Spam dishes in those days—so good that the state now consumes 7 million cans of the stuff a year, according to Spam.com. There’s a food festival&nbsp;called <a href=\"http://spamjamhawaii.com/\">Spam Jam</a>, which attracts 25,000 people a year.</p>\n<p>Last week, Reddit’s Hawaii community paid tribute to&nbsp;Barbara Funamura, the creator the first Spam musubi, who passed away&nbsp;at the age of 78.</p>\n<p>A primer:</p>\n<iframe height=\"745px\" width=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"//www.redditmedia.com/r/Hawaii/comments/4kuj99/creator_of_spam_musubi_passes_away_at_78/d3iduen?embed=true&amp;context=1&amp;depth=2&amp;showedits=true&amp;created=2016-06-12T07:05:21.720947+00:00&amp;showmore=false\" style=\"height: 745px; width: 100%; display: block; max-width: 800px; min-width: 220px; margin: 10px 0px; box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588) 0px 0px 5px 0.5px; box-sizing: border-box;\"></iframe><script async=\"\" src=\"https://www.redditstatic.com/comment-embed.js\"></script>\n<p><fb:post href=\"https://www.facebook.com/spambrand/photos/a.210698122288795.60299.190425724316035/1104854662873132/?type=3&amp;theater\" class=\" fb_iframe_widget\" fb-xfbml-state=\"rendered\" fb-iframe-plugin-query=\"app_id=249643311490&amp;container_width=0&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fspambrand%2Fphotos%2Fa.210698122288795.60299.190425724316035%2F1104854662873132%2F%3Ftype%3D3%26theater&amp;locale=en_US&amp;sdk=joey\"><span style=\"vertical-align: bottom; width: 552px; height: 105px;\"><iframe name=\"f3ac69eda\" width=\"1000px\" height=\"1000px\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"fb:post Facebook Social Plugin\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/v2.3/plugins/post.php?app_id=249643311490&amp;channel=https%3A%2F%2Fstaticxx.facebook.com%2Fconnect%2Fxd_arbiter.php%3Fversion%3D42%23cb%3Df1617007dc%26domain%3Dupvoted.com%26origin%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fupvoted.com%252Ff288249ab4%26relation%3Dparent.parent&amp;container_width=0&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fspambrand%2Fphotos%2Fa.210698122288795.60299.190425724316035%2F1104854662873132%2F%3Ftype%3D3%26theater&amp;locale=en_US&amp;sdk=joey\" style=\"border: none; visibility: visible; width: 552px; height: 105px;\" class=\"\"></iframe></span></fb:post></p>\n<p>In the words of the Monty Python classic: “Spam!

	(75,'\n\n				<p><strong>It may be too late now to say sorry</strong>—but don’t expect Skrillex to be the one issuing an apology.</p>\n<p>Last Thursday, TMZ <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2016/05/26/justin-bieber-skrillex-sorry-lawsuit/\">reported</a> that indie pop singer-songwriter Casey Dienel&nbsp;is suing Justin Bieber and producer Skrillex over a striking similarity their chart-topping hit&nbsp;“Sorry” bears to&nbsp;Dienel’s 2014 song&nbsp;“Ring the Bell.”</p>\n<p>Shortly after the news broke, the bespectacled and uniquely coiffed&nbsp;DJ shot back at Dienel’s claims of plagiarism with a video demonstrating how he arrived at the signature riff. But before you watch Skrillex’s video defense, take a listen to the first few seconds of each song to judge for yourself.</p>\n<p>Here’s “Ring the Bell” by Casey Dienel (released&nbsp;under her musical pseudonym White Hinterland):</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><div class=\"fluid-width-video-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top: 61.47260273972602%;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_VW5xIXdfgw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" id=\"fitvid0\"></iframe></div></span></p>\n<p>And here’s “Sorry” (remember: You’re not watching this for the dancing—just listening for the riff):</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><div class=\"fluid-width-video-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top: 61.47260273972602%;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fRh_vgS2dFE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" id=\"fitvid1\"></iframe></div></span></p>\n<p>In&nbsp;Skrillex’s video, the producer breaks down&nbsp;the audio-editing process behind those signature high-pitched woos at the center of Dienel’s claims.</p>\n<p>“All right, so here’s the a cappella from the writing sessions of ‘Sorry,\'” he narrates, as he plays a track of the unmodulated voice of singer Julia Michaels.</p>\n<p>He then proceeds to make four&nbsp;simple edits that result in the riff that Dienel maintains&nbsp;the “Sorry” songwriters lifted from “Ring the Bell.”</p>\n<p>First, he lowers the pitch of the vocal track by a major third. Then, he raises the controversial “woo” riff up an octave. Finally, he loops the resulting snippet, adds some reverb, and voila: With a minimum of processing or fancy Top 40 production&nbsp;tricks, the unmistakable riff behind “Sorry” is clearly audible.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><div class=\"fluid-width-video-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top: 61.47260273972602%;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SXkOWgE7wPI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" id=\"fitvid2\"></iframe></div></span></p>\n<p>While Skrillex’s demonstration does not preclude the possibility that&nbsp;he and “Sorry” cowriters Michaels, Justin Tranter, and Michael Tucker worked backwards to recreate and modify Dienel’s riff (to evade accusations of uncleared sampling), the simplicity of his&nbsp;how-to does seem to cast doubt on&nbsp;Dienel’s allegations.</p>\n<p>In response to the video, many Reddit users familiar with both songs expressed skepticism about the underlying validity&nbsp;of the dispute:</p>\n<iframe height=\"225px\" width=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"//www.redditmedia.com/r/videos/comments/4lrylk/skrillex_accused_of_stealing_a_riff_in_the_intro/d3pvqxn?embed=true&amp;context=0&amp;depth=1&amp;showedits=true&amp;created=2016-06-12T07:05:28.200799+00:00&amp;showmore=false\" style=\"height: 225px; width: 100%; display: block; max-width: 800px; min-width: 220px; margin: 10px 0px; box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588) 0px 0px 5px 0.5px; box-sizing: border-box;\"></iframe><script async=\"\" src=\"https://www.redditstatic.com/comment-embed.js\"></script>\n<iframe height=\"404px\" width=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"//www.redditmedia.com/r/videos/comments/4lrylk/skrillex_accused_of_stealing_a_riff_in_the_intro/d3q2v35?embed=true&amp;context=0&amp;depth=1&amp;showedits=true&amp;created=2016-06-12T07:05:28.317256+00:00&amp;showmore=false\" style=\"height: 404px; width: 100%; display: block; max-width: 800px; min-width: 220px; margin: 10px 0px; box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588) 0px 0px 5px 0.5px; box-sizing: border-box;\"></iframe><script async=\"\" src=\"https://www.redditstatic.com/comment-embed.js\"></script>\n<p>As the case continues to unfold, TMZ caught up with producer and Skrillex/Bieber collaborator Diplo to get his thoughts on the accusations.</p>\n<p>“I’m sure they’ll work out a deal with her,” he says, referring to Bieber’s legal team.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><div class=\"fluid-width-video-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top: 61.47260273972602%;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dXa-L-6rvog?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" id=\"fitvid3\"></iframe></div></span></p>\n<p>For now, the case remains subject to speculation, with this post&nbsp;from White Hinterland’s Facebook page as Dienel’s final public statement on the claims:</p>\n	','https://upvoted.com/2016/06/01/did-skrillex-steal-this-riff-for-justin-biebers-sorry-producer-responds-to-accusations-in-new-video/'),

The word “Anthora” was Buck’s distinctive mispronunciation of “amphora,” the two-handled Greek pitcher associated with the same imagery that appears on the coffee cup. With Grecian-style design on the rise in mid-century <a href=\"http://www.jbdesign.it/idesignpro/ancient%20greece%20interiors.html\" target=\"_blank\">home </a><a href=\"http://www.jbdesign.it/idesignpro/ancient%20greece%20interiors.html\" target=\"_blank\">decor</a> and <a href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/21/5e/fe/215efe8f261b55218715ad734af29d21.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">fashion</a>, the cup\'s iconography&nbsp;would have been familiar to New Yorkers of the 1960s as an homage to Classical heritage. It\'s blue and white colors are an tribute to the Greek flag and its type design distinctly recalls Ancient Athenian lettering. The fact that it was a<strong> <br></strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x2\">\n<div class=\"fluid-row singlerow\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x1\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x1\">\n<p class=\"small mb-05 font-gray\"><strong>Author:</strong> <br>Tom Head</p>\n<p class=\"small mb-0 font-gray\"><strong>Photo:</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.hopesandfears.com/users/1226721\" target=\"_blank\">Lia Bekyan</a> for Hopes&amp;Fears</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"fluid-row singlerow\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x4\">\n<p>specifically Greek symbol was no accident; most of the to-go coffee in 1960s New York City was sold at Greek-American family restaurants, and the design’s homage to Greek culture made it appealing for merchants, while its warm slogan, “We Are Happy to Serve You,” soon satisfied&nbsp;customers of all backgrounds.</p>\n<p>The Anthora was the first of its kind, introducing the to-go coffee cup as we know it.&nbsp;Not to say that this was the first disposable cup; William F. Dart invented the styrofoam cup in 1957, and disposable paper coffee cups with handles (still popular in parts of Latin America) have been available since the 1930s. But the Anthora was the first handleless paper to-go coffee cup, innovating a basic design that nearly all coffee shops have come to use since.<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>Initially standing at a very squat 10 ounces when debuted by Sherri Cup in 1965, the contemporary version, sold by infamous red cup creator Solo (ironically now owned by Dart Container, the company started by the same William Dart who created the styrofoam cup that Buck’s invention would overtake), is both taller and slimmer than the original, reflecting the aesthetic stereotype of the City that the cup is most associated with. Today, both 8-ounce and 10-ounce versions are available.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 class=\"h3\"><strong><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" class=\"inline_icon-number-2 inline_icon\"> Materials and manufacturing</strong></h3>\n<p>Historically, the paper cup used materials from a relatively unregulated network of paper product suppliers. Now, industry leaders such as Dart/Solo source paper from suppliers who have received certification from the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI), a nonprofit created by the timber industry to encourage compliance with state and federal laws regulating the trade.</p>\n<p>Dart Container has 33 manufacturing plants throughout the world: 23 in the United States (including the corporate headquarters in Mason, Michigan), two in Canada, four in Latin America, three in the United Kingdom, and one in Australia. Paper cups are manufactured using a universal method, which is almost entirely automated and requiring little direct human labor. First, the design is printed onto a long roll of the polyethylene-coated paper, which is then cut into individual pieces, called “flats”. As the name suggests, flats look as though you’ve cut the side of the cup down from top to bottom and flattened them out. The flats are then heat-sealed into cylinders, with bottoms made out of the same polyethylene-coated paper heat-sealed on the bottom. The finished product is a watertight and relatively heat-resistant container made of plastic-coated paper.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 class=\"h3\"><strong><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" class=\"inline_icon-number-3 inline_icon\">&nbsp;Marketing and pop culture<br></strong></h3>\n<p>In this case, the Anthora Cup essentially sold itself; New Yorkers needed coffee, and the Greek diner or deli was where they were getting it. As the first disposable cup without obtrusive handles, it was a matter of convenience for a population known for being on the go. With this in mind, it’s obvious why the cup has become synonymous with New York; Anthora has appeared in countless films and TV shows set in New York City, including, but by no means limited to <em>Law &amp; Order</em>, <em>NYPD Blue</em> and <em>Men in Black</em>. In fact, the design was so important to the aesthetic of NYC that production designer Bob Shaw used it to help convey a convincing ‘90s-era NYC atmosphere for <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x2\">\n<div class=\"spec pseudosidebar-target\"><!-- START Double Click Ad Unit Tag — Sidebar -->\n<!-- /257123819/300x600 -->\n<div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1433933472395-0\">\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\ngoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display(\'div-gpt-ad-1433933472395-0\'); });\n</script><div id=\"div-gpt-ad-1433933472395-0_ad_container\">\n<ins style=\"width: 300px; height: 600px; display: inline-table; position: relative; border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;\"><ins style=\"width: 300px; height: 600px; display: block; position: relative; border: 0px;\"><iframe id=\"google_ads_iframe_/257123819/300x600_0\" title=\"3rd party ad content\" name=\"google_ads_iframe_/257123819/300x600_0\" width=\"300\" height=\"600\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: 0px; position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px;\"></iframe></ins></ins></div>\n<script>googletag.impl.pubads.createDomIframe(\"div-gpt-ad-1433933472395-0_ad_container\" ,\"/257123819/300x600_0\",false,false);</script>\n</div>\n<!-- END Double Click Ad Unit Tag — Sidebar --></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class=\"h3\"><strong><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" class=\"inline_icon-number-4 inline_icon\"> Where they sold<br></strong></h3><div class=\"fluid-row singlerow\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x4\">\n<p>While the cup was nearly ubiquitous from its inception through the 1990s, the transition of coffee sales from diners to coffee shops cut deeply into the Anthora’s popularity. In 1994, over 500 million cups were sold—but by 2005, sales were down to 200 million. A year later, sales were at such a standstill that Solo Cup decided to completely halt the Anthora’s large-scale manufacturing and distribution.</p>\n<p>This didn’t completely obliterate the design’s existence, however; Solo sold licenses of the design to souvenir shops such as the New York Coffee Cup Company, which continued selling cups to New York City restaurants and other interested parties. The cup was adopted as a note-worthy New York icon by MoMA, which sells a ceramic version of the cup—a popular item for tourists and locals alike. And much like anything else of value sold in NYC, knockoffs popped up left and right.\'</p>\n<p>Despite the rapid pace of change in New York, the City is a stickler for nostalgia. So when Dart Container announced that it would be reintroducing the cup in December 2015, it was less the return of an era and more the end of a brief, halfhearted sabbatical. The Anthora cup is certainly back, but it never exactly left in the first place.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x2\">\n<div class=\"spec section-block\">\n<p>WHERE TO BUY</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-row singlerow\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x1\">\n<p class=\"xlarge mb-05 font-gray\"><strong>$20</strong></p>\n<p class=\"small font-gray\"><a href=\"http://www.nycoffeecup.com/shop/4577638173/50-ny-coffee-cups-lids/6025767\" target=\"_blank\">For 50 cups from New York Coffee Cup</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x1\">\n<p class=\"xlarge mb-05 font-gray\"><strong>$15</strong></p>\n<p class=\"small font-gray mb-0\"><a href=\"https://www.momastore.org/museum/moma/ProductDisplay_New%20York%20Coffee%20Cup_10451_10001_16678_-1_26669_26671\" target=\"_blank\">One ceramic mug from the MoMA Design Store</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><p>&nbsp;</p><h3 class=\"h3\"><strong><img src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==\" class=\"inline_icon-number-5 inline_icon\">&nbsp;Where they end up</strong></h3><div class=\"fluid-row singlerow mb-2\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x4\">\n<p>Unfortunately, the immortality of the Anthora cup carries all the way through its life cycle. The same polyethylene coating that holds a paper cup together and prevents coffee from leaking through makes it extremely difficult to recycle and dramatically reduces its compostability.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The popularity of paper coffee cups is rooted partly in the claim that polystyrene foam cups aren’t recyclable—a reputational challenge that Dart Container has had to contend with—but they are actually a great deal easier to recycle than polyethylene-coated paper cups. Dart now directs customers to <a href=\"https://www.dartcontainer.com/environment/ps-foam-recycling/\">dozens of polystyrene recycling facilities</a> throughout the United States, mostly on the east coast. Finding a paper recycling facility that will accept polyethylene-coated cups can be much more difficult. There appears to be none in New York City, with <a href=\"http://search.earth911.com/?what=Paper+Cups&amp;where=new+york+city&amp;list_filter=all&amp;max_distance=25&amp;family_id=&amp;latitude=&amp;longitude=&amp;country=&amp;province=&amp;city=\">the nearest</a> located in Keasbey, New Jersey. And while the paper in an Anthora cup composts relatively quickly, the plastic coating—which makes up as much as 5% of each cup’s volume—does not. Low-density polyethylene can take up to a thousand years to disintegrate even when exposed to sunlight and, if it’s buried, has <a href=\"http://www.brighthub.com/environment/green-living/articles/107380.aspx\">no clear reason</a> to disintegrate at all. It is entirely possible that, tens of thousands of years from now, plastic from billions of paper cups will lie undisturbed at the bottom of an abandoned landfill—by which time the Anthora design will be nearly as ancient, in relative terms, as the ancient Greek amphora designs that inspired it<strong>.</strong></p>\n<p>This is not to say that the paper cup industry isn’t taking measures to improve the biodegradability and recyclability of paper cups, but it seems to be a slow and challenging process. Starbucks made a public corporate effort to make 100% of its cups recyclable by the end of 2015, but <a href=\"http://www.greenbiz.com/article/4-ways-starbucks-can-fix-its-cup-recycling-dilemma\">conceded failure</a> by the end of the year as it became increasingly clear that they were not on track to meet that target. It’s not yet clear how close the industry is to developing a more environmentally friendly disposable paper coffee cup that functions as well as the polyethylene-coated wonders we’re using today, but it’s a safe bet that some of them will feature the words “We Are Happy to Serve You.” So far, the Anthora design has proven to be every bit as durable as the polyethylene that coats it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x2\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"fluid-row singlerow\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x3\">\n<p class=\"mb-0\"><span class=\"img-with-caption\" style=\"\"><img src=\"http://lamcdn.net/hopesandfears.com/post_image-image/ERl3fw2_-VVR9igZH6sgNQ-wide.jpg\" class=\"image image_2621973\" width=\"460\" height=\"460\" alt=\"The life, death and rebirth of &quot;New York\'s Coffee Cup&quot; Anthora.

First of all, I see through your facade and can tell when you\'re calling me a jerk. Secondly, being born in December isn’t why I am a jerk. Chemical imbalances and a childhood that primed me to be defensive is why I am a jerk. It has offended me to imply that the reason I get so defensive is related to astrology, because that erases my experiences from my personality while also taking credit for them. Oh really? My Mars is in Aries? Get bent.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-0\">But hey, maybe I am wrong! Maybe there is something to this. For the week leading up to my 27th birthday, I tried to live my life taking cues from my horoscope.</p>\n</div>\n</div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\"fluid-row singlerow\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x2\">\n<h3 class=\"h3 mb-0\"><strong>Day 1</strong></h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x4\">\n<h3 class=\"h3 mb-0\">December 8th, 2015</h3>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"fluid-row singlerow mb-4 col-ltr\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x2\">\n<div class=\"spec section-block\">\n<p>horoscope&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"large font-copper\">Sinking into the depths of your feelings may be necessary to release a negative charge that has turned into an unhealthy anchor. You might assume you can just cut an emotional tie that binds you and be free of it once and for all — but it’s never quite that simple. This unconventional strategy isn’t about making a quick escape; instead, seek ways to add more passion into your life. Fortunately, you receive more cosmic inspiration today by irrepressible Uranus as it invites you to explore life’s mysteries. Spontaneous expression is your friend.</p>\n<p class=\"small\"><a href=\"http://www.dailyhoroscope.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DailyHoroscope.com</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x4\">\n<p>I woke up to a text from my sister asking how I felt about starting physical therapy later that day. I have two bulging discs in my neck.&nbsp;I understand that experiencing emotions is an important part of living a rich and fulfilling life and all that bullshit, but talking about my feelings is not going to fix my neck. Making art. Going on dates. Watching <em>Toy Story 3</em>. These are all things that can only be done properly while fully immersed in emotion—which there is a time and place for—but if left out all the time emotions risk being tripped over.&nbsp;Until I need to rewatch the last episode of <em>The Office</em> and have a good cry, I will keep my emotional side in a safe place until I need to use it, like a hammer.</p>\n<p>I have never done physical therapy because I’ve never been this injured before. The doctor asked how I hurt my neck, so I said “I dunno”&nbsp;while avoiding eye contact, as if telling the truth might prompt him to call my mother. The session was alienating and consisted of repeated movements that seemed incapable of fixing my spine. I started to feel anxious before I reminded myself that feelings equal hammer, and assured myself that circling my head with my hand will be an adept substitute for invasive surgery.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-0\">When I left the office, I went left instead of right. This was my spontaneous expression. There was a park a few blocks from my apartment, and in the entire year I have lived in this neighborhood I have never explored it. Past its border are dirt trails that lead to these giant cliffs directly above Harlem River Drive. From up there, I could see empty beer bottles and a few used condoms, but I could also see the Hudson River, Yankee Stadium, and a cityscape of The Bronx that is more short grey buildings than tall shiny ones, and yet is just as beautiful. It is a shame that it took me so long to get out there, but I felt more calm than regret.</p>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"fluid-row singlerow\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x2\">\n<h3 class=\"h3 mb-0\"><strong>Day 2</strong></h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x4\">\n<h3 class=\"h3 mb-0\">December 9th, 2015</h3>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"fluid-row singlerow mb-4 col-ltr\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x2\">\n<div class=\"spec section-block\">\n<p>HOROSCOPE</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"large font-copper\">Your feelings may be hurt today as unkind words are thrown at you by someone who’s trying to manipulate your loyalties. Normally, you would laugh, let this negativity go and move on. However, the Moon’s return to your sign heightens your sensitivity, inspiring you to respond with sincerity even while maintaining a non-judgmental attitude. Meanwhile, Mercury shifts into a cautious Capricorn tonight, teaching you an important lesson about the virtue of patience if you’re willing to listen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"small\"><a href=\"http://www.dailyhoroscope.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DailyHoroscope.com</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x4\">\n<p>Doing bookkeeping for an arts nonprofit isn’t exactly the backstabbing primetime soap opera world my horoscope had predicted for the day, which is exactly why I like doing accounting. It is objective. Numbers are numbers. However, it can get emotional. A rent invoice was accidentally sent to someone who was moving out at the end of the month, and they wrote me an email asking if I was keeping their deposit. My horoscope felt inaccurate, but I was possibly being closed-mind and should have looked harder. It seems as if this is something I should not be trying to look for, as I believe it is better to be vulnerable to manipulation than it is to live in fear and second guess the intentions of those close to you.</p>\n<p>Once the sun started to go down I closed my laptop and got on the floor to do my physical therapy. Being injured is a constant urgence. It is pain, your body telling you something is wrong and you need to fix it immediately, and you carry it with you everywhere all day. It’s not crippling, but the pain is like a metronome in the back of my neck keeping time and never allowing me to be in silence.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-0\">I set an alarm on my phone for an hour and put it away to focus on my stretches and little movements. My favorite is the one from yesterday that I mentioned earlier when I rotate my hand around my head. It reminds me of when a cartoon character gets hit with an anvil, and instead of death they get a parade of birds circling their face. Doing this, I thought about whether or not someone was plotting to take advantage of my emotions, or what lessons of patience doing accounting could have taught me. It seemed vague and, overall, my day seemed inconsequential.</p>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"fluid-row singlerow\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x2\">\n<h3 class=\"h3 mb-0\"><strong>Day 3</strong></h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x4\">\n<h3 class=\"h3 mb-0\">December 10th, 2015</h3>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"fluid-row singlerow mb-4\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x2\">\n<div class=\"spec section-block\">\n<p>Horoscope</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"font-copper large\">Sun in Sagittarius square Chiron in Pisces; Mercury enters Capricorn</p>\n<p class=\"large font-copper small\">The Sun represents our identity. Chiron represents the wound that will never heal but that can constantly inform us. Painfully present in this moment in time is the archetype of the wounded self gone awry.</p>\n<p class=\"large font-copper small\">What makes someone pick up a gun and harm others? What is happening in us when we think violence is the only answer or the only way through the pain we feel? What wound are we carrying, each one of us, that could make us cause harm. Each of us carries with us the potential to heal and the potential to harm. None of us are exempt from this. None of us are above this.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"large font-copper small\">All of us have the responsibility to extend ourselves to help, love and create space for justice in our lives, in our communities and in our world. If we can choose the path of healing, if we are able to make that choice, this is the time to choose it.</p>\n<p class=\"large font-copper small\">Later in the month (December 19th) Mercury will conjoin Pluto and square Uranus (December 20th). This means that there is a lot of revolutionary, revealing and deepening communications to come. Stay tuned…&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"mb-2 small\"><a href=\"http://chaninicholas.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chani Nicholas</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x4\">\n<p>After receiving multiple recommendations, I decided to try out astrology guru Chani Nicholas\'s predictions. His are more communal as opposed to individualist, so instead of personal divination it is an analysis of the sky’s influence on the world.</p>\n<p>That night, I was to have dinner with Sara. Sara had recently moved back to New York when she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. She was living in Detroit and working as a photographer until a year ago when her body mysteriously started to turn on her. We were best friends in high school, and now we are both in New York worrying about our bodies slowly falling apart, although her ailments are far more serious and not self-inflicted from trying to lift weights with her neck.</p>\n<p>Multiple sclerosis can’t be cured, only managed. Sara was telling me what foods help inflammation and what foods make it worse, to which I responded with “Oh, very interesting I should see if that helps with my spine,” as I shoved a burrito into my mouth and ordered a side of nachos. After dinner I went to the gym, because I guess I was curious to see what it would be like to have a pre-workout of Mexican food, an espresso, and 2 light beers.</p>\n<p>I exercised until it hurt too much. Not the numbing endorphin-filled good pain that a trip to the gym can provide, but a sharp pain. The doctor had said exercising was fine, but here I was in pain unsure if I was being a baby or if I was trap bar shrugging myself into a wheelchair. So I went home and collapsed to my floor somewhat voluntarily in an attempt to do some physical therapy, which I neglected to do prior to the gym because Mexican food. After about the halfway mark I stopped.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-0\">Chani’s horoscope focused on the permeating negativity in our world and ended on a hopeful note of healing. I want to heal, but what is that? I still do not even know if I can get my spine back to normal. All the things a younger me would call “healing,” I now call “maintenance.”</p>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"fluid-row singlerow\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x2\">\n<h3 class=\"h3 mb-0\"><strong>Day 4</strong></h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x4\">\n<h3 class=\"h3 mb-0\">December 11th, 2015</h3>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"fluid-row singlerow mb-4\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x2\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x4\">\n<p>Finding no solace in a lot of the overarching charts, I decided to delve into my birth chart, another concept that was suggested to me by several friends. Everyone was happy that I was opening up, but their suggestions were that I follow an elaborate chart derived from the year, time of day, latitude and longitude of my birth. It made me feel like how I felt in high school when I would say I listened to Sonic Youth, and then someone on a message board would tell me that what I really needed to hear was this weird record of saxophone screeching from 1978.</p>\n<p class=\"font-copper center\"><em><span class=\"img-with-caption\" style=\"\"><img src=\"http://lamcdn.net/hopesandfears.com/post_image-image/dBEQBq3OBQ2XkyjpaRCvcA-wide.png\" class=\"image image_2621953\" width=\"471\" height=\"579\" alt=\"I followed a different horoscope every day for a week and it bullshat on my soul.

Answering emails on my phone. Reading a book on the subway. A guy got on my train in the 10 nonstop minutes between 125th and 59th and started talking about conspiracies. 9/11. AIDS. The moon landing. Kennedy getting shot. The Constitution. They’re all connected, apparently, though&nbsp;I don’t get how.</p>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"fluid-row singlerow\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x2\">\n<h3 class=\"h3 mb-0\"><strong>Day 5</strong></h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x4\">\n<h3 class=\"h3 mb-0\">December 12th, 2015&nbsp;</h3>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"fluid-row singlerow mb-4\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x2\">\n<div class=\"spec section-block\">\n<p>HOROSCOPE</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"large font-copper\">If a peaceful day of rest was on your agenda today, Sagittarius, you better get out your eraser and revise a few things. Although your day may start out casually with a calm and settled tone, it can quickly become quite hectic and demanding. Even though you may not have thought you wanted a quiet day, you will quickly become drawn into the events and activities that happen. This is good because an opportunity is coming your way that will require your enthusiasm and your stamina. By tomorrow, you may be able to get some of that rest you were planning on.</p>\n<p class=\"small mb-0 font-gray\">DailyHoroscope iOS app</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x4\">\n<p>I had a very busy day planned the night before, down to the half hour. But my day started with me sleeping in two hours and then not getting out of bed until I had been away for another three. At first, I thought I was hungover, but I quickly realized that I haven’t drank alcohol in days and that I was actually paralyzingly depressed, which is actually a lot like being hungover in some ways; it’s often a coming out party for the things you thought you could keep in your stomach when you went to bed.</p>\n<p>I was supposed to see my friends. I didn’t. I was supposed to get some work done. I didn’t. I was supposed to do my therapy, and that is two days in a row now that I had skipped it. There was also a bus I was supposed to catch as my leftover schedule from last night had me leaving right after midnight to catch a bus to my mother’s house to go Christmas tree shopping in the morning with her and my sister. There is a farm in upstate New York my family goes to every year to pick up our Christmas tree. Generally, I dislike farms. I think if humans were made to stay in nature we wouldn’t have left it in the first place. If my species has evolved to the point where wheat gluten has become the new ipecac syrup then maybe it would best if we all just stayed in Manhattan. It used to be my father’s job to complain about Christmas and temper everyone’s enthusiasm, but now it is mine.</p>\n<p>At around midnight I found myself cursing two guys dressed up as Santa Claus as they stole the only available cab from me.&nbsp;I settled in a bar a few blocks away, when what to my wondering eyes should appear but a miniature room and eighty drunken Santa Clauses. A famous seasonal bar crawl, SantaCon, was that day, and I sat at the bar until close. Sure, maybe some of those people are kind and charitable, yet I would safely bet that if you feel comfortable dressing as Santa and being drunk in public then you probably are not the type of person who feels comfortable lending some of their agency to the stars and Universe.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-0\">SantaCon makes me feel as if I am being haunted by the ghost of Christmas Past, and it has taken the form of dudes whose body language makes me feel uncomfortable. Since getting myself to do anything today took so long I decided to pull an overnight as opposed to go back to my apartment and wake-up early. I will make it upstate.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"fluid-row singlerow\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x2\">\n<h3 class=\"h3 mb-0\"><strong>Day 6</strong></h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x4\">\n<h3 class=\"h3 mb-0\">December 13th, 2015&nbsp;</h3>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"fluid-row singlerow mb-4\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x2\">\n<div class=\"spec section-block\">\n<p>HOROSCOPE</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"large font-copper\">Others may assume that you are in a bad mood today because you are so focused on your work. To others you may appear to be cold or gruff or out of sorts, and you may have to respond to many questions about that. If you react in a way that conveys interruption or frustration or impatience, you will only score what they already think. If you take a moment to react thoughtfully, though, others will catch on to your diligent efforts and your concentrated mindset and will leave you in your business.</p>\n<p class=\"small font-gray mb-0\">DailyHoroscope iOS app</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x4\">\n<p>I leave the bar at 5 in the morning with pain shooting down my back and arms all over again. The bus back to my mother’s didn’t get there until noon, so I took an earlier bus to the halfway point and attempted to hitchhike the rest of the way back. I have done this before, but only at an hour with an abundance of stoned teenagers on the road, which, from my research, makes up 100% demographic of people who pick up hitchhikers. There weren\'t too many of them in upstate New York on a Sunday morning, so I tried to sober up on the shoulder of the Orange Turnpike with some coffee until eventually calling for a ride.</p>\n<p>Hours later and still having not slept, I dragged the tree into the house and fit it into the mount, which involved a lot more sawing and wrenching then I remember from watching my father do it. I remember he would get down on his knees and then back to his feet through groans and gritted teeth. When I was growing up, all the men in my life laboured when they moved. They said this is what happens when you get older. They said this is what happens when you do stupid shit when you are younger. I am still unclear if these two warnings are actually the same.</p>\n<p>I never thought this would be me, but I feel crippled by the weight of my own idiocracy, and all the things it has done to my body, and every decision I make coming with the additional question of, “Will this make it better or worse?” For example, putting all my weight on one elbow and both my knees while twisting my torso so I am upside down so I can better wrench in a Christmas tree: better or worse?</p>\n<p class=\"mb-0\">When I was done, my mother commented that I grunted and swore as much as my father did when he did work around the house. Fantastic.</p>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"fluid-row singlerow\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x2\">\n<h3 class=\"h3 mb-0\"><strong>Day 7</strong></h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x4\">\n<h3 class=\"h3 mb-0\">December 14th, 2015&nbsp;</h3>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"fluid-row singlerow\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x2\">\n<div class=\"spec section-block\">\n<p>HOROSCOPE</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"large font-copper\">If you review a certain memory too many times, you could wind up playing the “what if” game incessantly. There is no shortage of answers to the question “what might have been?” The problem with that, thought, is that we have no way of knowing how things would have worked out if only this or that or the other had not happened the way it did. Don’t drive yourself crazy going over something you have no power to change. Leave the past in the past today, and focus on the present and the future. That’s where your moment of shining abundance and great prosperity is waiting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"small font-gray mb-0\">DailyHoroscope iOS app</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x4\">\n<p>My neck was much worse. My entire upper back felt so tense I couldn’t tell if my posture was straight or hunched over. My hands felt weird, as I was unable to tell if it was from my spine or just fear. My day was spent propped up my pillows in bed trying not to move as I worked on my laptop. The next day was my 27th birthday.</p>\n<p>The future feels different than it used to. It always felt like the present but with more; my life continuing to get better or worse depending on my mood at the time. For the first time, the future feels like a deterioration, as if my age is a time bomb, and I am worried that instead of an explosion, a sight, it will open up limply to reveal a handwritten note reading “bang” as if I am some shitty Batman villain. It would be nice to go into this scary new future with some faith, any faith, to keep me company.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-0\">I went into this experiment hoping that it would open me up to a world less literal and utilitarian than the one I am used to. Maybe I did it wrong and I should have looked for meaning harder. I hope it isn’t the case that I am too closed-minded to learn anything, but if that isn’t the case then what I am left with? I don’t want to be right, because if the person who knows best is me, then I am left right where I am now, injured in bed huddled around a laptop under my covers as if this is how a healthy person lives their life. There is either something or nothing, and I really want there to be something, but so far all I can believe is there is nothing. But if I am to leave the past in the past, as suggested, then I am going to have to go against what I have always believed.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div><p class=\"small font-gray center\">Edited and produced by Mike Sheffield&nbsp;</p>','http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/now/experiment/217067-horoscopes-nonbeliever'),

He has been prototyping for over a year out of his Brooklyn-based laboratory, The New Flesh Workshop.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-0\">The New Flesh Workshop toes the line between multidisciplinary garage and a menagerie of oddities; loose bolts and nuts are sorted in model skulls, an articulated composite and Kevlar glove resists the tight grip of a vice. A pirate’s peg leg—replete with an etching of a schooner—stands proudly next to the Workshop’s founder. Established out of Kane’s garage in 2007 after he dropped out of Drexel University’s biomedical engineering program because they were “slowing him down,” The New Flesh Workshop has served as a factory for the prototyping and production of customized protective gear and wearable technology with the vision of redefining human capabilities.</p>\n</div>\n</div><div class=\"fluid-row singlerow\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x4\">\n<p>“The goal of the New Flesh Workshop is to give people superhuman abilities,” Kane tells Hopes&amp;Fears. “My definition of a superhuman ability is something you cannot train your body to do.” It’s the difference between a skill, such as optimizing the body with exercise and coaching to become the fastest runner on earth, and using technology to extend beyond the mortal; take Aimee Mullins, for example, a double leg amputee and athletic pioneer who has leveraged her prosthetics to enhance her body in every way from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mokPWCTPZY\" target=\"_blank\">speed</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/aimee_mullins_prosthetic_aesthetics\" target=\"_blank\">height</a>.</p>\n<p>Kane has&nbsp;<strong></strong>undertaken this vision from two angles: the first, by prototyping experimental armor systems that allow<strong>&nbsp;</strong>users to protect their bodies in dangerous environments such as burning or collapsing buildings.&nbsp; The second, by embracing those who need prosthetic replacements for missing or lost body parts as having the potential perform at higher levels than any biologically complete body. Or in Kane’s words, “Why would you replace a missing arm with a worse version of an arm, when you can have it shoot lasers instead?”</p>\n<p>Kane hasn’t created any laser-shooting prosthetics…yet. But he has applied his method to a number of differently-abled clients—mostly artists and performers—who share his philosophy. “I make prosthetics for artists who are, in one way or another, challenged to do their art because of their abnormality,” Kane explains, “so I help them find the tools that allow them to express themselves and engage in their craft.” He customized a prosthetic pinky with an interchangeable tool tip for an engineer, and a protective torso guard for Eduardo Garcia, an extreme sports enthusiast who lost several ribs in an electrical accident, so he could continue&nbsp; snowboarding.</p>\n<p>In this way, Kane has gained a reputation as a sort of mad scientist for the eccentric—hence, the comic book-worthy pseudonym.

In fact, Vasquez’s former partner, Walker Fee, rented desk space in Kane’s Workshop to use as an art studio. Before long, Kane noticed that Vasquez was missing all but the pierced lobe of her right ear, a skein of scar tissue where the rest of the ear, including canal, would normally be.</p>\n<p>Vasquez was born with microtia, a congenital ear abnormality which results in the partial or total loss of the outer ear and often the ear canal. Often the internal structures that are capable of hearing are still intact, but they cannot be reached by airwaves and compression needed for regular hearing because of the lack of an opening. “It took a while for me to notice because Juliannah usually covered it with her wild hair, and the lobe was pierced,” Kane recalls. “Plus she has a generally spunky attitude, so you’d never know that sometimes she literally couldn’t hear you.”</p>\n<p>After considering his options, Kane approached Juliannah and told her that he wanted to make her a functioning ear. “Doc and I were at this giant festival together and he comes up to me at six in the morning when the party is finally wrapping up,” Vasquez tells Hopes&amp;Fears, “and he just says, ‘I want to make you a robot ear.’” It was something she had been waiting to hear her entire life. “I just started crying on the spot,” Vasquez recalls, “I will remember that moment forever.”</p>\n<p class=\"mb-0\">Vasquez’s lifelong battle with microtia has been painfully debilitating. She experienced her first surgery at the age of four, when doctors cut through her undeveloped ear canal opening in order to assess the viability of her interior hearing organs, commencing a long string of hospital visits that would span her childhood. In second grade, Vasquez had a silicone ear implanted under grafted skin, a surgery that confined her to a wheelchair for about a year. The implant had no function beyond the aesthetic—to make her appear “normal.” Instead, it made Vasquez’s childhood more difficult than her doctors or family could imagine. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x1\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"mb-05\"><span class=\"img-with-caption\" style=\"\"><img src=\"http://lamcdn.net/hopesandfears.com/post_image-image/WDir8y1GnxjnvZw6HQAwMA-wide.jpg\" class=\"image image_2621935\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" alt=\"Doctor Adventure makes an ear!.

Her body never took to the ear—a chronic infection formed a perpetual wound that would force her to take antibiotics every two or three months—completely obliterating her immune system—and over the next few years it became obvious that her body was rejecting the implant.</p>\n<p>So Vasquez made one last trip to the hospital to have the implant removed, placing her back at square one—but with a far more emboldened spirit. “I wanted to accept the beauty of my body as it was,” she said, “it felt like my spirit was reacting to something that wasn’t a part of me. I think having that attitude was part of the reason my body rejected it.”</p>\n<p>Unlike Vasquez’s prior experiences with medical professionals, Kane makes no assumptions about the needs or desires of those he collaborates with. His process starts with a basic physiological assessment of the situation from the fundamental (what is the medical prognoses?), to the functional (what do you want or need to be able to do that you can’t do now?), to the esoteric (now that you are a cyborg, what type of cyborg do you want to look like? How do we take your weakness and make it a superpower?). “If you’re differently-abled, what your body can do is different than what others can naturally do, so just to get everyone on an even keel to start with is a big part of our prosthetics focus—so get your life back, express yourself and love your body,” Kane explains. “Once you can do those things, then the question is how to move beyond it.”</p>\n<p class=\"mb-0\">In Vasquez’s case, she could not hear from her right side, which made it difficult to pursue her passion for music. It’s especially hard for her to perform live, because she can’t even hear herself over other instrumentals and a noisy audience. And like many artists struggling with the high cost of rent and metro cards in New York City, Vasquez relies on her bike to keep transportation costs low. So she often fears for her safety since she can’t totally hear traffic around her.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x1\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div><p>&nbsp;</p><div class=\"fluid-row singlerow mb-05\">\n<div class=\"fluid-block x4\">\n<h2 class=\"mb-0 h2\"><span class=\"img-with-caption\" style=\"\"><img src=\"http://lamcdn.net/hopesandfears.com/post_image-image/3mLfRQNB_tR_f60YaxwxDg-wide.jpg\" class=\"image image_2621955\" width=\"620\" height=\"930\" alt=\"Doctor Adventure makes an ear!.

One who could transform into an elf. Or a robot. Or hide under the cloak of normalcy, if necessary. Thus, a year of research and prototyping began.</p>\n<p>Kane already had an idea of how he was going to approach the challenge before ever presenting his idea to Vasquez. Vasquez could not receive sound via air; she could, however, hear sound conducted by physical vibration. So Kane thought a transducer, a small metal disc which vibrates at the same frequencies as the sounds it receives, would do the trick. A transducer will transfer sound directly into the skull when held against it, essentially turning the bone into an amplifier of sorts. It’s like those&nbsp;<a href=\"http://old.thing.net/wwwboard1/messages/683.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sound Bites</a>&nbsp;singing lollipops from the late \'90s that \"Lets you hear music inside your head\"; by applying sound vibrations to the tooth the music suddenly becomes really loud, as though there’s a small radio inside your head.</p>\n<p><strong><strong></strong></strong>The first prototype was straightforward; using an ordinary pair of headphones, he replaced the right earbud with a conductive transducer so that sound would translate via disc, making the right channel a vibrational pad that could resonate sound through her skull. It doesn’t seem like much, but for Vasquez, the result was life-changing. Vasquez had never heard in stereo before; her hearing was flat—an aural equivalent of walking through a three-dimensional world but only seeing it as though you were watching it all on a screen. For the first time in her life, music had a depth.</p>\n<p><strong><strong></strong></strong>“I was shocked that I could hear such specific notes and beats I never knew existed before,” she says, “it was like someone opening blinds and I never even knew there was an outside.” This alone opened Vasquez’s eyes to possibilities in music that she had dismissed as lost causes—DJing, or even producing her own music, for instance—as they required hearing on both sides.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-0\">But Kane had committed to making Vasquez an ear—an appendage that could translate noise as it was created around her, rather than just a tool she could use to listen to recorded music and other recorded sound. Beyond that, Kane wanted to create something that Vasquez could develop a relationship with as part of her body—something that could be identified as <em>her</em> ear.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x1\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div><p>&nbsp;</p><p><div class=\"b-slideshow\"><div class=\"b-slideshow-controls\" style=\"top: 627px;\"><h4 class=\"title\"></h4><div class=\"left\"></div><div class=\"status\"><span><strong class=\"slide-current\">1</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<strong class=\"slide-total\">5</strong></span></div><div class=\"right\"></div><div class=\"clear\"><div></div></div></div><div class=\"b-slideshow-photos\" style=\"height: 634px;\"><span class=\"img-with-caption\" style=\"\"><img src=\"http://lamcdn.net/hopesandfears.com/post_image-image/7a1l1-9Lb5VS92aBhygFnQ-wide.jpg\" class=\"image image_2621937\" width=\"940\" height=\"627\" alt=\"Silicone model of Vasquez\'s missing ear location, made using an alginate cast.

Using a standard hearing aid, Kane replaced the receiver bud with a transducer, just like the headphones. The next step was making the proper ear itself, starting with an alginate model of Vasquez’s deformed ear which Kane developed into a silicone model. Then, using a dummy hearing aid in conjunction with the silicone model, he created a positive plaster mold that would shape the space needed for the final hearing aid and residual lobe of the ear. Finally, Kane used a two-part mold—a negative relief of the final silicone ear design on one side, the plaster positive mold on the other—to shape a working prototype of the prosthetic ear. “We had to work through at least half a dozen prototypes to just get the hearing aid component functioning,” Kane recalls, “then we had to figure out making a mold for a silicone ear, so there was a lot of experimentation with techniques, materials, pigments, stuff like that.”</p>\n<p>Even in its prototypical form, Kane’s design was regularly stunning Vasquez every time she tested it. “We tried out a prototype and I could hear the bus going by, people walking around, a dog barking across the street—it was all so loud,” Vasquez recalls. The little sounds often taken for granted were something that she had never heard before. “I was literally weeping for three minutes straight. It was all so loud.” Then there were the more practical developments; Vasquez, for instance, never knew how loudly or softly she was speaking because of her partial deafness. “I am constantly told that I am too loud, or even losing my voice, because I can barely hear myself over other people or loud noises,” she says. Until now, she could never assess speed or distance of objects around her because she wasn’t capable of hearing the shifting sound of objects passing from one side of her to the other, and her sense of balance was a constant challenge. She’s excited to lose the awkwardness of moving someone over to her left side so she can hear what they’re saying, and having to repeatedly ask her conversation partners to repeat themselves. “Now I don’t have to explain to people why I’m clumsy or loud,” Vasquez says.</p>\n<p>The final prosthetic is a 3D-printed ear scanned from a sculpt conceived by Juliannah’s friend Paul. Its silver robotic design distinctly cyborgian—a celebration of her missing appendage rather than an attempt to hide it. With the ear complete, the final hurdle to cross was how exactly Vasquez could attach it to her body.</p>\n<p>More often than not, prosthetics attach to the body using a suspension system that holds the device to the remaining portion of a missing limb, which is fitted into the prosthetic’s socket. These devices are what people most commonly associate with prosthetics—artificial devices to replace the bottom portion of a missing arm or leg for instance. In Vasquez’s case, there was no residual limb; her attachment point was the side of her face, a flat surface that lends no protrusion to which a prosthetic can be suspended. Without surgery such as a bone fixation—a procedure in which a prosthetic is literally screwed into your bone—Kane decided to employ transdermal implants.</p>\n<p>A transdermal implant is a form of body modification that places an object just below the skin with part of it exposed externally. While transdermal implants are used medically, they are frequently affiliated with extreme body modification culture, with enthusiasts embedding small, threaded bases below the skin in which they can screw jewelry such as spikes and studs. Transdermal implants for cosmetic use were popularized by surgical equipment designer Steve Haworth and fellow body modification artist Jesse Jarrell, who terrified millions of suburban mothers across America with their “Metal Mohawk”, a more-punk-than-punk mohawk that used transdermal metal spikes instead of Elmer’s glued hair. “I had known about Haworth and Jarrell since I was 16 and so that was always something I’ve done a ton of R&amp;D for,” Kane says. “That’s why I went to school for Biomedical Engineering—so I could learn about the materials and techniques, as well as the anatomical concerns of putting things into people’s bodies.”</p>\n<p>Implanting transdermal jewelry is not a simple process, and definitely not for the faint of heart. With the location implant marked on the skin, the body modification expert creates a small incision about an inch away from the final point. He then elevates the skin to make a small pocket through which he can slide the jewelry and, using a dermal punch, creates a hole in the skin where it is marked. He can then push the jewelry under the skin and into the corresponding hole.</p>\n<p><strong><strong></strong></strong>In Vasquez’s case, Kane designed a magnetic transdermal implant system that would use four magnetic bolts that could hold the prosthetic, retrofitted with corresponding magnets, to her head. This would allow her to interchange the ear design based on her need or mood, as well as remove the piece so she could sleep without it. All in all, the procedure for Vasquez took around three grueling hours; and since it was not medical, there was no anaesthetic involved. “We had talked about the procedure beforehand, but I didn’t really comprehend the specifics,” Vasquez recalls. “It was definitely one of the most painful and traumatic experiences I had put my body through.” She could actually hear her skin tearing and it took all the strength she could muster to keep from jerking her body out of pain.</p>\n<p class=\"mb-0\"><strong><strong></strong></strong>Despite this, Vasquez sees this final step as a rebirthing—a test of mental and physical stamina that she had to experience in order to embody her incarnation as a cyborg. “It really, really tested how much I was willing to invest in being able to hear, she says.” Vasquez is certain it was all worth it. “Just the fact that maybe one day I’ll be able to have someone whisper into that ear that they love me… I’ve been looking forward to the day where I don’t have to fear that I’m less than everyone else. I no longer feel that way.”</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fluid-block x1\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>','http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/future/technology/217097-doctor-adventure-makes-an-ear'),

Rather than spray painting a coat or holding up signs outside of corporate HQ, they <a href=\"http://www.peta.org/blog/hermes-newest-shareholder-is-peta/\" target=\"_blank\">invested</a> in Hermès International, buying one share for $370.33.</p>\n<h4>Hmmmm… Why?</h4>\n<p>Last week, PETA put their purchased share to good use by <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/movies/peta-hermes-shareholder-questions-brand-exotic-skins-193505327.html\" target=\"_blank\">sending “representatives”</a> to Hermès’ annual shareholder meeting in Paris.</p>\n<p>In front of hundreds of other shareholders and the press, PETA called out Hermès’ CEO, Axel Dumas, directly, and read aloud allegations of animal cruelty.</p>\n<h4>Apparently this strategy works</h4>\n<p>PETA’s tactics have put Hermès on the defensive after they simultaneously released a report on gruesome alligator and crocodile farming.</p>\n<p>The sometimes extreme animal rights organization has used this shareholder tactic in the past against companies like McDonald’s, Safeway, DuPont, and Gap when they felt the companies weren’t “making enough progress on animal welfare issues.” Considering they just became a shareholder in <a href=\"http://www.peta.org/blog/pradas-newest-shareholder-peta/\" target=\"_blank\">Prada</a> last month, we can expect to see the tactic employed again very soon.</p>\n<p>Ethically-sourced hats off to you, PETA. That’s a pretty nifty way to get attention.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"wework\" style=\"padding-top:70px;margin-top:-50px;\">Work/life balance</h2>\n<p>Back in January, WeWork <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3055325/from-wework-to-welive-company-moves-members-into-its-first-residential-building\" target=\"_blank\">launched</a> a flexible housing spin-off called WeLive in Manhattan and Washington D.C.. It was the perfect living option for millennials in need of pay-by-the-month, furnished rentals.</p>\n<p>Now they’ve <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3060537/wework-quietly-opens-hotel-rooms-in-new-york-city?partner=rss\" target=\"_blank\">added another option</a>: hotel rooms.</p>\n<p>For $235 a night, visitors in New York City can rent a “studio plus” apartment with two beds, or snag a room with four beds for $495/night.</p>\n<h4>Is that legal?</h4>\n<p>As Airbnb has learned, New York City bans short-term rentals in residential buildings for shorter than 30 days. </p>\n<p>However, WeWork can get away with it because the 39 units on three floors inside of WeLive are designated for hotel use…and the building is located in a district that allows both residential and commercial use.</p>\n<h4>More cash for a giant</h4>\n<p>As we noted in a <a href=\"http://thehustle.co/why-wework-is-worth-so-much\" target=\"_blank\">recent article</a>, WeWork is valued at a cool $16B. Which is insane.</p>\n<p>And according to the company, WeLive should account for a fifth of their annual revenue by 2018. This seemed a little crazy when the idea of WeLive was first getting off the ground, but now it seems realistic.</p>\n<p>So far, 100% of the longer-term rental units in their New York City WeLive location are full. Add in this hotel option and you can see the insane opportunity they have here.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"crazy\" style=\"padding-top:70px;margin-top:-50px;\">I feel like I’m taking crazy pills</h2>\n<p>Arif Ahmed al-Zarouni, a businessman from the United Arab Emirates, just paid roughly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/05/uae-licence-plate-1-auction-arif-ahmed-al-zarouni\" target=\"_blank\">$4.9m</a> at an auction for a license plate bearing the number “1” and nothing else.</p>\n<p>“My ambition is always to be number one,” he said.</p>\n<p>Somehow this isn’t the highest sum ever paid for a numbered license plate in the UAE. Back in 2008, someone paid $14.2m for one at auction.</p>\n<h4>Meanwhile, in America…</h4>\n<p>Remember that “Can you hear me now?” guy from the old <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPwPo-IAQ-E\" target=\"_blank\">Verizon commercials</a>? His name is Paul Marcarelli, and he’s got a new gig…working as a <a href=\"http://www.recode.net/2016/6/5/11863706/verizon-sprint-pitch-man\" target=\"_blank\">pitchman for Sprint</a>.</p>\n<p>Come on, man! That’s like the PC guy using a mac. Or Flo joining the Hoopers. Or Jared raving about Quiznos’ toasted subs (too soon?). Can’t go switching sides like that.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"snapchat\" style=\"padding-top:70px;margin-top:-50px;\">Snapchat’s going 3D</h2>\n<p>Techcrunch <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/06/03/snapchat-secretly-acquires-seene-a-computer-vision-startup-that-lets-mobile-users-make-3d-selfies/\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> a post on Friday claiming that Snapchat acquired 3D photo app maker Seene. Unfortunately for the story, however, the deal supposedly happened in secret 2 months ago and hasn’t yet been confirmed by either company. So… speculation!</p>\n<p>First, a little about Seene. Picture an easy way for your phone to create an exact 3D model of your face with just a few left-right selfie scans. Then, imagine that model thrown into virtual reality or placed in a movie of some sort where you’re an action hero jumping out of a window. Here’s an unsmiling man <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLMOpt5invA\" target=\"_blank\">demonstrating</a> the product.</p>\n<p>Plus, don’t forget about augmented reality. Seene’s tech also allows for users to play beach volleyball against each other around a Corona bottle or animate a freakin’ lego man. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f01O3FEpfIo\" target=\"_blank\">See it</a>, believe it.</p>\n<h4>But let’s hold our horses</h4>\n<p>Snapchat’s been making waves with its camera filters. Apart from the billions of dog-licking-the-camera videos, advertisers are starting to pay big bucks to get in the filter lineup, and the team from Seene could open up the doors to a whole new category.</p>\n<p>That said, Techcrunch also reported that the deal’s price tag was low, so this may be more of an acquihire situation rather than a straight up product acquisition. Snapchat needs computer vision talent and sometimes buying a company is easier than trying to recruit.</p>\n<div class=\"code-block code-block-16\" style=\"margin:8px 0px;\"><hr style=\"margin:40px 0;\">\n<strong>A note from The Hustle:</strong> We send a daily newsletter that summarizes important news topics relating to business, tech, and culture.

To promote the app, America’s favorite Christian nugget shack offering a free chicken sandwich to anyone who downloads and creates a profile before June 11. And before you ask– here are the links to the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chick-fil-a/id488818252?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chickfila.cfaflagship&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Google Play</a> stores. Yawelcome.</p>\n<p>The app lets you order ahead, pay with your phone, and collect reward points. Nothing too crazy and, honestly, you can say anything after “free chicken sandwich” and people will download it.</p>\n<p>“Sign up and get a free chicken sandwich. The app flashes you the middle finger before it deletes your phone’s data, all while making sly comments about your weight.” See?</p>\n<h4>What it means to be number one</h4>\n<p>App store rankings are based on number of downloads. In order to become top cheddar in the free category, you likely need over 80k downloads a day.</p>\n<p>That is, of course, if the app store doesn’t <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/06/02/apple-app-store-goes-down/?ncid=rss\" target=\"_blank\">crash</a> like it did yesterday for four whole hours. The internet freaked out, surely some engineers at Apple started to rethink their life choices, but somehow the cacographic cows* finally got their message across.</p>\n<p>* Hint: it means they’re bad spellurs.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"dogs\" style=\"padding-top:70px;margin-top:-50px;\">Old dogs, new tricks</h2>\n<p>PricewaterhouseCoopers, the largest professional services firm in the world, just scrapped its dress code in an attempt to increase the creativity of its employees.</p>\n<p>Stuffy, old school company decides to become less stuffy and old school? Cool. Totally get it. But does PwC really think relaxing their dress code is the key to igniting creativity? </p>\n<p>Seems more like the classic, “Hey, those guys out in Silicon Valley wear hoodies and flip flops, right? Well, they seem creative. Let’s do that.” Little more complicated than that, fellas.</p>\n<p>Then again, this could simply be PwC making a statement after a female receptionist working as a temp in their London office was sent home without pay earlier this month for refusing to wear high heels. </p>\n<h4>And in other news…</h4>\n<p>Tribune Publishing, the storied 168 year old company which owns respectable newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, just announced that it will soon rebrand as tronc*, Inc.</p>\n<p>Dafuq? tronc. Lowercase ‘t’, asterisk and everything.</p>\n<p>Apparently, it’s supposed to be short for “tribune online content” and represent innovation. But let’s be real…this is just weird. </p>\n<p>And likely decided after about six too many mojitos by 50-somethings who just picked up on the “quirky name spelled weird” phase that’s been going on in tech for the last decade.</p>\n<p>Reminiscent of Airbnb’s rebranding debacle, tronc has started reach some new heights on the internet. Some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ditzkoff/status/738478489322586112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">guy on Twitter</a> made our week with this one:</p>\n<p><em>HOLD THE TRUNK, HOLD THR TRUNK, HOLD TRUNK, TRONC.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"walmart\" style=\"padding-top:70px;margin-top:-50px;\">A new way to shop at Wally World</h2>\n<p>Our friends over at Walmart want to <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/06/02/walmart-will-test-last-mile-grocery-delivery-via-uber-lyft-and-deliv/?ncid=rss\" target=\"_blank\">test</a> grocery delivery, using Uber and Lyft as their delivery fleet. Pretty cool.</p>\n<p>Logistically, here’s how it’ll work: A customer places an order online. Then, a specially trained “Walmart Personal Shopper” (aka. some dude frantically running around with a list) fills the order, placing all frozen or fresh items in temperature-controlled holding areas. Finally, that shopper requests an Uber or Lyft who then picks up the prepared groceries and heads to the customer’s location.</p>\n<p>Nothing too revolutionary. Companies like Instacart, Amazon Fresh, and Peopod provide are full-time providers of essentially the same service.</p>\n<h4>But there is one huge differentiator…</h4>\n<p>And that’s price.</p>\n<p>While most of the companies who do this markup the cost of groceries online (Instacart charges up to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/22/technology/personaltech/online-grocery-start-up-takes-page-from-sharing-services.html?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\">20% more</a> for certain items), Walmart won’t. It’s why their curbside pickup has done so well. Customers aren’t paying <em>more</em> for the convenience, it’s just a different way to order.</p>\n<p>If they’re able to maintain an affordable delivery service (they claim the delivery fee will be between $7 and $10 to offset the third-party car service cost), Walmart could tap into a massive audience:</p>\n<p>Lazy Americans who like eating but aren’t willing to pay premium prices or download trendy apps like Instacart.

It was not until 1964 that residents of DC could even vote for president.</p>\n<p>Take Janet Brown, an 84-year-old great-grandmother. “When I came to the district in 1958, because I got married to somebody who lived here, I felt as though I had been robbed of my citizenship,” she testified at a town hall meeting this week. “I’ve felt that way ever since.”</p>\n<p>Campaigns for statehood have come and gone and run into Republican opposition. Senator Edward Kennedy once described the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/16/archives/washington-dc-and-the-six-toos.html\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"in-body-link\" class=\"u-underline\">opposition arguments as the “four too’s”</a>: a fear that DC would be too black, too urban, too Democratic and too liberal. Since then, the black population has dipped below 50%, but there is little doubt the political colour of the new state, which would elect one voting member to the House and two to the Senate, would be staunchly blue.</p>\n<p>John Kasich, who was a Republican candidate for president this year, said candidly of statehood: “That’s just more votes in the Democratic party.”</p>\n<p>A Donald Trump-inspired meltdown, however, could give Democrats the upper hand and a rare chance to push for the goal.

The central bank’s constant dithering over whether to raise interest rates has made it appear weak and unable to influence events.</p>\n<p>In the seven years of what, in many economics textbooks, would be considered a strong recovery, the Fed has raised rates just once – by a quarter-percentage point to 0.5%, in December last year.</p>\n<p>More than eight million jobs have been created in the US since 2010, and the country’s GDP is now well above its pre-crisis peak – having risen from <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD/countries/US?display=graph\" title=\"\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" data-component=\"in-body-link\" class=\"u-underline\">$14.7&nbsp;trillion in 2008 to $17.4tn in 2014</a>.</p>\n<p>According to its critics, the Fed has set the bar for rate increases too high. Sure, they say, the path of growth has not always been smooth, and indeed the first three months of this year did constitute a weak spot. But, they also say, president Barack Obama’s determination in the years immediately after 2008 to meet the crisis head on – with the most aggressive write-offs of banking sector bad loans in the developed world – set the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" class=\"u-underline\">US economy</a> on a relentless upward trajectory that boosted confidence and investment.</p>\n<p>It will come as no surprise, though, should Yellen hold rates yet again on Tuesday. She will say that the generally strong headline growth figures disguise serious weaknesses in the US economy. The combination of turbulent financial markets and an uncertain outlook for the global economy as China slows and Europe contemplates the possible fallout from a Brexit vote, calls for cool heads, and a wait and see approach.</p>\n<p>Yellen’s worries can be divided into five main categories.</p>\n<h2><strong>The US jobs market</strong></h2>\n<figure itemprop=\"associatedMedia image\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" data-component=\"image\" class=\"element element-image img--landscape  fig--narrow-caption fig--has-shares \" data-media-id=\"00343bc898dad84796d98d734d35f948eb5aa74a\" id=\"img-2\">\n<meta itemprop=\"url\" content=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00343bc898dad84796d98d734d35f948eb5aa74a/76_0_3888_2334/master/3888.jpg?w=300&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=c9fe127e112b503ba16fb1226409507f\">\n<meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"3888\">\n<meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"2334\">\n<a href=\"#img-2\" class=\"article__img-container js-gallerythumbs\" data-link-name=\"Launch Article Lightbox\" data-is-ajax>\n<div class=\"u-responsive-ratio\" style=\"padding-bottom: 60.03%\">\n<picture>\n<!--[if IE 9]><video style=\"display: none;\"><![endif]-->\n<source media=\"(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" sizes=\"620px\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00343bc898dad84796d98d734d35f948eb5aa74a/76_0_3888_2334/master/3888.jpg?w=620&amp;q=20&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=1a3131a55d46f7ae09750dba51976959 1240w\">\n<source media=\"(min-width: 660px)\" sizes=\"620px\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00343bc898dad84796d98d734d35f948eb5aa74a/76_0_3888_2334/master/3888.jpg?w=620&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=815ca88d4379a67e3b970d90e1c9d288 620w\">\n<source media=\"(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" sizes=\"605px\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00343bc898dad84796d98d734d35f948eb5aa74a/76_0_3888_2334/master/3888.jpg?w=605&amp;q=20&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=bc6b26250f0cdfeffce1b1bb84e3400c 1210w\">\n<source media=\"(min-width: 480px)\" sizes=\"605px\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00343bc898dad84796d98d734d35f948eb5aa74a/76_0_3888_2334/master/3888.jpg?w=605&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=26edc59b146172937be83a0eb6372523 605w\">\n<source media=\"(min-width: 0px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 0px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)\" sizes=\"445px\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00343bc898dad84796d98d734d35f948eb5aa74a/76_0_3888_2334/master/3888.jpg?w=445&amp;q=20&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=4e99b5a79cc1e95f1685ec7eb571ac42 890w\">\n<source media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" sizes=\"445px\" srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00343bc898dad84796d98d734d35f948eb5aa74a/76_0_3888_2334/master/3888.jpg?w=445&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=569b8775b1391e7f00ab81e55a7957b0 445w\">\n<!--[if IE 9]></video><![endif]-->\n<img class=\"gu-image\" itemprop=\"contentUrl\" alt=\"Union members protest demanding jobs\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00343bc898dad84796d98d734d35f948eb5aa74a/76_0_3888_2334/master/3888.jpg?w=300&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=c9fe127e112b503ba16fb1226409507f\">\n</picture>','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/11/yellen-federal-reserve-interest-rates-jobs-china-brexit');

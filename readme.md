## Description
### Yoast SEO Research
At Yoast we always want to improve our products. But sometimes we cannot do that all by ourselves, therefore we need your help! To refinine the SEO & content analysis of our Yoast SEO plugin we are looking for some site owners that want to help us out by providing some posts and/or pages from their sites as reference material. 

### How can you help? 
We’d like to ask you to download the following plugin. This plugin retrieves 10 posts or pages, and 5 taxonomies for us to analyze. We are going to take a look at the keyword, content, meta description, title, generated SEO title, and URL, in order to recalibrate the content analysis. Your site’s data will only be used for research purposes by Yoast and will not be sold or made public. 

### Who can help? 
Anyone who uses [Yoast SEO](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/) or [Yoast SEO Premium](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/) on a WordPress website.

Thanks for your contribution!
